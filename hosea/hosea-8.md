# Hosea 8

**1** Set the trumpet to thy mouth. He shall come as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law. ^hosea-8-1

**2** Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee. ^hosea-8-2

**3** Israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the enemy shall pursue him. ^hosea-8-3

**4** They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off. ^hosea-8-4

**5** Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency? ^hosea-8-5

**6** For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces. ^hosea-8-6

**7** For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up. ^hosea-8-7

**8** Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure. ^hosea-8-8

**9** For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers. ^hosea-8-9

**10** Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes. ^hosea-8-10

**11** Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin. ^hosea-8-11

**12** I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing. ^hosea-8-12

**13** They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt. ^hosea-8-13

**14** For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof. ^hosea-8-14
