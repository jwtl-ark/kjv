# Hosea 4

**1** Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land. ^hosea-4-1

**2** By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood. ^hosea-4-2

**3** Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away. ^hosea-4-3

**4** Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are as they that strive with the priest. ^hosea-4-4

**5** Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother. ^hosea-4-5

**6** My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children. ^hosea-4-6

**7** As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will I change their glory into shame. ^hosea-4-7

**8** They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity. ^hosea-4-8

**9** And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings. ^hosea-4-9

**10** For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD. ^hosea-4-10

**11** Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart. ^hosea-4-11

**12** My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God. ^hosea-4-12

**13** They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery. ^hosea-4-13

**14** I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall. ^hosea-4-14

**15** Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD liveth. ^hosea-4-15

**16** For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place. ^hosea-4-16

**17** Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone. ^hosea-4-17

**18** Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers with shame do love, Give ye. ^hosea-4-18

**19** The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices. ^hosea-4-19
