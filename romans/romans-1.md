# Romans 1

**1** Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, ^romans-1-1

**2** (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,) ^romans-1-2

**3** Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh; ^romans-1-3

**4** And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead: ^romans-1-4

**5** By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name: ^romans-1-5

**6** Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ: ^romans-1-6

**7** To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. ^romans-1-7

**8** First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. ^romans-1-8

**9** For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers; ^romans-1-9

**10** Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you. ^romans-1-10

**11** For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established; ^romans-1-11

**12** That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me. ^romans-1-12

**13** Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles. ^romans-1-13

**14** I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise. ^romans-1-14

**15** So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also. ^romans-1-15

**16** For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. ^romans-1-16

**17** For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith. ^romans-1-17

**18** For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; ^romans-1-18

**19** Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. ^romans-1-19

**20** For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: ^romans-1-20

**21** Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. ^romans-1-21

**22** Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, ^romans-1-22

**23** And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. ^romans-1-23

**24** Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: ^romans-1-24

**25** Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen. ^romans-1-25

**26** For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: ^romans-1-26

**27** And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet. ^romans-1-27

**28** And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; ^romans-1-28

**29** Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, ^romans-1-29

**30** Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, ^romans-1-30

**31** Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: ^romans-1-31

**32** Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them. ^romans-1-32
