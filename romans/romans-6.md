# Romans 6

**1** What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? ^romans-6-1

**2** God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? ^romans-6-2

**3** Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? ^romans-6-3

**4** Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. ^romans-6-4

**5** For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: ^romans-6-5

**6** Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. ^romans-6-6

**7** For he that is dead is freed from sin. ^romans-6-7

**8** Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him: ^romans-6-8

**9** Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him. ^romans-6-9

**10** For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. ^romans-6-10

**11** Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. ^romans-6-11

**12** Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. ^romans-6-12

**13** Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. ^romans-6-13

**14** For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace. ^romans-6-14

**15** What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid. ^romans-6-15

**16** Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? ^romans-6-16

**17** But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. ^romans-6-17

**18** Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness. ^romans-6-18

**19** I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness. ^romans-6-19

**20** For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness. ^romans-6-20

**21** What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death. ^romans-6-21

**22** But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. ^romans-6-22

**23** For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. ^romans-6-23
