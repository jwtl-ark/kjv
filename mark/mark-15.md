# Mark 15

**1** And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate. ^mark-15-1

**2** And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest it. ^mark-15-2

**3** And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing. ^mark-15-3

**4** And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee. ^mark-15-4

**5** But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled. ^mark-15-5

**6** Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired. ^mark-15-6

**7** And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection. ^mark-15-7

**8** And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them. ^mark-15-8

**9** But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews? ^mark-15-9

**10** For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy. ^mark-15-10

**11** But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them. ^mark-15-11

**12** And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews? ^mark-15-12

**13** And they cried out again, Crucify him. ^mark-15-13

**14** Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him. ^mark-15-14

**15** And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified. ^mark-15-15

**16** And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band. ^mark-15-16

**17** And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head, ^mark-15-17

**18** And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! ^mark-15-18

**19** And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him. ^mark-15-19

**20** And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him. ^mark-15-20

**21** And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross. ^mark-15-21

**22** And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull. ^mark-15-22

**23** And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not. ^mark-15-23

**24** And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take. ^mark-15-24

**25** And it was the third hour, and they crucified him. ^mark-15-25

**26** And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS. ^mark-15-26

**27** And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left. ^mark-15-27

**28** And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors. ^mark-15-28

**29** And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, ^mark-15-29

**30** Save thyself, and come down from the cross. ^mark-15-30

**31** Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save. ^mark-15-31

**32** Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him. ^mark-15-32

**33** And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. ^mark-15-33

**34** And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? ^mark-15-34

**35** And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias. ^mark-15-35

**36** And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down. ^mark-15-36

**37** And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost. ^mark-15-37

**38** And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom. ^mark-15-38

**39** And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God. ^mark-15-39

**40** There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome; ^mark-15-40

**41** (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem. ^mark-15-41

**42** And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath, ^mark-15-42

**43** Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus. ^mark-15-43

**44** And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead. ^mark-15-44

**45** And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. ^mark-15-45

**46** And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre. ^mark-15-46

**47** And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid. ^mark-15-47
