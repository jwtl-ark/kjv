# Zephaniah 3

**1** Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city! ^zephaniah-3-1

**2** She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God. ^zephaniah-3-2

**3** Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow. ^zephaniah-3-3

**4** Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law. ^zephaniah-3-4

**5** The just LORD is in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame. ^zephaniah-3-5

**6** I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant. ^zephaniah-3-6

**7** I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: but they rose early, and corrupted all their doings. ^zephaniah-3-7

**8** Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy. ^zephaniah-3-8

**9** For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent. ^zephaniah-3-9

**10** From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering. ^zephaniah-3-10

**11** In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain. ^zephaniah-3-11

**12** I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD. ^zephaniah-3-12

**13** The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid. ^zephaniah-3-13

**14** Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem. ^zephaniah-3-14

**15** The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the king of Israel, even the LORD, is in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more. ^zephaniah-3-15

**16** In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack. ^zephaniah-3-16

**17** The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing. ^zephaniah-3-17

**18** I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly, who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden. ^zephaniah-3-18

**19** Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame. ^zephaniah-3-19

**20** At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the LORD. ^zephaniah-3-20
