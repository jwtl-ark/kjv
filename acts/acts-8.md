# Acts 8

**1** And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles. ^acts-8-1

**2** And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him. ^acts-8-2

**3** As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison. ^acts-8-3

**4** Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word. ^acts-8-4

**5** Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them. ^acts-8-5

**6** And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. ^acts-8-6

**7** For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed. ^acts-8-7

**8** And there was great joy in that city. ^acts-8-8

**9** But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one: ^acts-8-9

**10** To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God. ^acts-8-10

**11** And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries. ^acts-8-11

**12** But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. ^acts-8-12

**13** Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done. ^acts-8-13

**14** Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: ^acts-8-14

**15** Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost: ^acts-8-15

**16** (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) ^acts-8-16

**17** Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost. ^acts-8-17

**18** And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, ^acts-8-18

**19** Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. ^acts-8-19

**20** But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. ^acts-8-20

**21** Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God. ^acts-8-21

**22** Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee. ^acts-8-22

**23** For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity. ^acts-8-23

**24** Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me. ^acts-8-24

**25** And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans. ^acts-8-25

**26** And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert. ^acts-8-26

**27** And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship, ^acts-8-27

**28** Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet. ^acts-8-28

**29** Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot. ^acts-8-29

**30** And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest? ^acts-8-30

**31** And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him. ^acts-8-31

**32** The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth: ^acts-8-32

**33** In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth. ^acts-8-33

**34** And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man? ^acts-8-34

**35** Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus. ^acts-8-35

**36** And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? ^acts-8-36

**37** And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. ^acts-8-37

**38** And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. ^acts-8-38

**39** And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing. ^acts-8-39

**40** But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea. ^acts-8-40
