# Galatians 5

**1** Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. ^galatians-5-1

**2** Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. ^galatians-5-2

**3** For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. ^galatians-5-3

**4** Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace. ^galatians-5-4

**5** For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. ^galatians-5-5

**6** For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love. ^galatians-5-6

**7** Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth? ^galatians-5-7

**8** This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you. ^galatians-5-8

**9** A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. ^galatians-5-9

**10** I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be. ^galatians-5-10

**11** And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased. ^galatians-5-11

**12** I would they were even cut off which trouble you. ^galatians-5-12

**13** For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. ^galatians-5-13

**14** For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. ^galatians-5-14

**15** But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another. ^galatians-5-15

**16** This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. ^galatians-5-16

**17** For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. ^galatians-5-17

**18** But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law. ^galatians-5-18

**19** Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, ^galatians-5-19

**20** Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, ^galatians-5-20

**21** Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. ^galatians-5-21

**22** But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, ^galatians-5-22

**23** Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. ^galatians-5-23

**24** And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. ^galatians-5-24

**25** If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. ^galatians-5-25

**26** Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another. ^galatians-5-26
