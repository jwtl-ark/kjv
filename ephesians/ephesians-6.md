# Ephesians 6

**1** Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. ^ephesians-6-1

**2** Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise; ^ephesians-6-2

**3** That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth. ^ephesians-6-3

**4** And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. ^ephesians-6-4

**5** Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ; ^ephesians-6-5

**6** Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; ^ephesians-6-6

**7** With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men: ^ephesians-6-7

**8** Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free. ^ephesians-6-8

**9** And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him. ^ephesians-6-9

**10** Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. ^ephesians-6-10

**11** Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. ^ephesians-6-11

**12** For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. ^ephesians-6-12

**13** Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. ^ephesians-6-13

**14** Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; ^ephesians-6-14

**15** And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; ^ephesians-6-15

**16** Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. ^ephesians-6-16

**17** And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: ^ephesians-6-17

**18** Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints; ^ephesians-6-18

**19** And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel, ^ephesians-6-19

**20** For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. ^ephesians-6-20

**21** But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things: ^ephesians-6-21

**22** Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts. ^ephesians-6-22

**23** Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. ^ephesians-6-23

**24** Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen. ^ephesians-6-24
