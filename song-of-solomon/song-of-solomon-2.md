# Song of Solomon 2

**1** I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys. ^song-of-solomon-2-1

**2** As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters. ^song-of-solomon-2-2

**3** As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste. ^song-of-solomon-2-3

**4** He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love. ^song-of-solomon-2-4

**5** Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love. ^song-of-solomon-2-5

**6** His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me. ^song-of-solomon-2-6

**7** I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please. ^song-of-solomon-2-7

**8** The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills. ^song-of-solomon-2-8

**9** My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice. ^song-of-solomon-2-9

**10** My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away. ^song-of-solomon-2-10

**11** For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; ^song-of-solomon-2-11

**12** The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; ^song-of-solomon-2-12

**13** The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. ^song-of-solomon-2-13

**14** O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely. ^song-of-solomon-2-14

**15** Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes. ^song-of-solomon-2-15

**16** My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies. ^song-of-solomon-2-16

**17** Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether. ^song-of-solomon-2-17
