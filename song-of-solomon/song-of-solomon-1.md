# Song of Solomon 1

**1** The song of songs, which is Solomon’s. ^song-of-solomon-1-1

**2** Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine. ^song-of-solomon-1-2

**3** Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee. ^song-of-solomon-1-3

**4** Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee. ^song-of-solomon-1-4

**5** I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon. ^song-of-solomon-1-5

**6** Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother’s children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept. ^song-of-solomon-1-6

**7** Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions? ^song-of-solomon-1-7

**8** If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds’ tents. ^song-of-solomon-1-8

**9** I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh’s chariots. ^song-of-solomon-1-9

**10** Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with chains of gold. ^song-of-solomon-1-10

**11** We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver. ^song-of-solomon-1-11

**12** While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof. ^song-of-solomon-1-12

**13** A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts. ^song-of-solomon-1-13

**14** My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi. ^song-of-solomon-1-14

**15** Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves’ eyes. ^song-of-solomon-1-15

**16** Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed is green. ^song-of-solomon-1-16

**17** The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir. ^song-of-solomon-1-17
