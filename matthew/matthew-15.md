# Matthew 15

**1** Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, ^matthew-15-1

**2** Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. ^matthew-15-2

**3** But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? ^matthew-15-3

**4** For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death. ^matthew-15-4

**5** But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; ^matthew-15-5

**6** And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. ^matthew-15-6

**7** Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, ^matthew-15-7

**8** This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. ^matthew-15-8

**9** But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. ^matthew-15-9

**10** And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand: ^matthew-15-10

**11** Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. ^matthew-15-11

**12** Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying? ^matthew-15-12

**13** But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up. ^matthew-15-13

**14** Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch. ^matthew-15-14

**15** Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable. ^matthew-15-15

**16** And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding? ^matthew-15-16

**17** Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? ^matthew-15-17

**18** But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. ^matthew-15-18

**19** For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: ^matthew-15-19

**20** These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man. ^matthew-15-20

**21** Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. ^matthew-15-21

**22** And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. ^matthew-15-22

**23** But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. ^matthew-15-23

**24** But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. ^matthew-15-24

**25** Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. ^matthew-15-25

**26** But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it to dogs. ^matthew-15-26

**27** And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table. ^matthew-15-27

**28** Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour. ^matthew-15-28

**29** And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there. ^matthew-15-29

**30** And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus’ feet; and he healed them: ^matthew-15-30

**31** Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel. ^matthew-15-31

**32** Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way. ^matthew-15-32

**33** And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude? ^matthew-15-33

**34** And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes. ^matthew-15-34

**35** And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. ^matthew-15-35

**36** And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. ^matthew-15-36

**37** And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full. ^matthew-15-37

**38** And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children. ^matthew-15-38

**39** And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala. ^matthew-15-39
