# Matthew 28

**1** In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre. ^matthew-28-1

**2** And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. ^matthew-28-2

**3** His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: ^matthew-28-3

**4** And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men. ^matthew-28-4

**5** And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. ^matthew-28-5

**6** He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. ^matthew-28-6

**7** And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you. ^matthew-28-7

**8** And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word. ^matthew-28-8

**9** And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him. ^matthew-28-9

**10** Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me. ^matthew-28-10

**11** Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done. ^matthew-28-11

**12** And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, ^matthew-28-12

**13** Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept. ^matthew-28-13

**14** And if this come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him, and secure you. ^matthew-28-14

**15** So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day. ^matthew-28-15

**16** Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. ^matthew-28-16

**17** And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted. ^matthew-28-17

**18** And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. ^matthew-28-18

**19** Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: ^matthew-28-19

**20** Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen. ^matthew-28-20
