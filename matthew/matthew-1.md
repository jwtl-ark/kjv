# Matthew 1

**1** The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. ^matthew-1-1

**2** Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren; ^matthew-1-2

**3** And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram; ^matthew-1-3

**4** And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon; ^matthew-1-4

**5** And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse; ^matthew-1-5

**6** And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias; ^matthew-1-6

**7** And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa; ^matthew-1-7

**8** And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias; ^matthew-1-8

**9** And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias; ^matthew-1-9

**10** And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias; ^matthew-1-10

**11** And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon: ^matthew-1-11

**12** And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel; ^matthew-1-12

**13** And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor; ^matthew-1-13

**14** And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud; ^matthew-1-14

**15** And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob; ^matthew-1-15

**16** And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. ^matthew-1-16

**17** So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations. ^matthew-1-17

**18** Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. ^matthew-1-18

**19** Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily. ^matthew-1-19

**20** But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. ^matthew-1-20

**21** And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins. ^matthew-1-21

**22** Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, ^matthew-1-22

**23** Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. ^matthew-1-23

**24** Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: ^matthew-1-24

**25** And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS. ^matthew-1-25
