# Hebrews 13

**1** Let brotherly love continue. ^hebrews-13-1

**2** Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. ^hebrews-13-2

**3** Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body. ^hebrews-13-3

**4** Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge. ^hebrews-13-4

**5** Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. ^hebrews-13-5

**6** So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. ^hebrews-13-6

**7** Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation. ^hebrews-13-7

**8** Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever. ^hebrews-13-8

**9** Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein. ^hebrews-13-9

**10** We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle. ^hebrews-13-10

**11** For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp. ^hebrews-13-11

**12** Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate. ^hebrews-13-12

**13** Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. ^hebrews-13-13

**14** For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come. ^hebrews-13-14

**15** By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name. ^hebrews-13-15

**16** But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased. ^hebrews-13-16

**17** Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you. ^hebrews-13-17

**18** Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly. ^hebrews-13-18

**19** But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner. ^hebrews-13-19

**20** Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, ^hebrews-13-20

**21** Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. ^hebrews-13-21

**22** And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words. ^hebrews-13-22

**23** Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you. ^hebrews-13-23

**24** Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you. ^hebrews-13-24

**25** Grace be with you all. Amen. ^hebrews-13-25
