# James 3

**1** My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation. ^james-3-1

**2** For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body. ^james-3-2

**3** Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body. ^james-3-3

**4** Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth. ^james-3-4

**5** Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth! ^james-3-5

**6** And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell. ^james-3-6

**7** For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind: ^james-3-7

**8** But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. ^james-3-8

**9** Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God. ^james-3-9

**10** Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be. ^james-3-10

**11** Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter? ^james-3-11

**12** Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh. ^james-3-12

**13** Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. ^james-3-13

**14** But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth. ^james-3-14

**15** This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish. ^james-3-15

**16** For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work. ^james-3-16

**17** But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. ^james-3-17

**18** And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace. ^james-3-18
