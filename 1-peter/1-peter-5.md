# 1 Peter 5

**1** The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: ^1-peter-5-1

**2** Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; ^1-peter-5-2

**3** Neither as being lords over God’s heritage, but being ensamples to the flock. ^1-peter-5-3

**4** And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away. ^1-peter-5-4

**5** Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. ^1-peter-5-5

**6** Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time: ^1-peter-5-6

**7** Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you. ^1-peter-5-7

**8** Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: ^1-peter-5-8

**9** Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world. ^1-peter-5-9

**10** But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you. ^1-peter-5-10

**11** To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. ^1-peter-5-11

**12** By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand. ^1-peter-5-12

**13** The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son. ^1-peter-5-13

**14** Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen. ^1-peter-5-14
