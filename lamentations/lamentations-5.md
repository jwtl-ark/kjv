# Lamentations 5

**1** Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our reproach. ^lamentations-5-1

**2** Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens. ^lamentations-5-2

**3** We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows. ^lamentations-5-3

**4** We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us. ^lamentations-5-4

**5** Our necks are under persecution: we labour, and have no rest. ^lamentations-5-5

**6** We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread. ^lamentations-5-6

**7** Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their iniquities. ^lamentations-5-7

**8** Servants have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver us out of their hand. ^lamentations-5-8

**9** We gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness. ^lamentations-5-9

**10** Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine. ^lamentations-5-10

**11** They ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the cities of Judah. ^lamentations-5-11

**12** Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured. ^lamentations-5-12

**13** They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood. ^lamentations-5-13

**14** The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their musick. ^lamentations-5-14

**15** The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning. ^lamentations-5-15

**16** The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us, that we have sinned! ^lamentations-5-16

**17** For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are dim. ^lamentations-5-17

**18** Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it. ^lamentations-5-18

**19** Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to generation. ^lamentations-5-19

**20** Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long time? ^lamentations-5-20

**21** Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old. ^lamentations-5-21

**22** But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us. ^lamentations-5-22
