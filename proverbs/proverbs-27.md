# Proverbs 27

**1** Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth. ^proverbs-27-1

**2** Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips. ^proverbs-27-2

**3** A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool’s wrath is heavier than them both. ^proverbs-27-3

**4** Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy? ^proverbs-27-4

**5** Open rebuke is better than secret love. ^proverbs-27-5

**6** Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful. ^proverbs-27-6

**7** The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet. ^proverbs-27-7

**8** As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his place. ^proverbs-27-8

**9** Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness of a man’s friend by hearty counsel. ^proverbs-27-9

**10** Thine own friend, and thy father’s friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother’s house in the day of thy calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off. ^proverbs-27-10

**11** My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me. ^proverbs-27-11

**12** A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished. ^proverbs-27-12

**13** Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman. ^proverbs-27-13

**14** He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him. ^proverbs-27-14

**15** A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike. ^proverbs-27-15

**16** Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself. ^proverbs-27-16

**17** Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend. ^proverbs-27-17

**18** Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured. ^proverbs-27-18

**19** As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man. ^proverbs-27-19

**20** Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied. ^proverbs-27-20

**21** As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a man to his praise. ^proverbs-27-21

**22** Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him. ^proverbs-27-22

**23** Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds. ^proverbs-27-23

**24** For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to every generation? ^proverbs-27-24

**25** The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered. ^proverbs-27-25

**26** The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of the field. ^proverbs-27-26

**27** And thou shalt have goats’ milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy maidens. ^proverbs-27-27
