# Proverbs 25

**1** These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out. ^proverbs-25-1

**2** It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter. ^proverbs-25-2

**3** The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable. ^proverbs-25-3

**4** Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer. ^proverbs-25-4

**5** Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness. ^proverbs-25-5

**6** Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men: ^proverbs-25-6

**7** For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen. ^proverbs-25-7

**8** Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame. ^proverbs-25-8

**9** Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not a secret to another: ^proverbs-25-9

**10** Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away. ^proverbs-25-10

**11** A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver. ^proverbs-25-11

**12** As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear. ^proverbs-25-12

**13** As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters. ^proverbs-25-13

**14** Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain. ^proverbs-25-14

**15** By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone. ^proverbs-25-15

**16** Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it. ^proverbs-25-16

**17** Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour’s house; lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee. ^proverbs-25-17

**18** A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow. ^proverbs-25-18

**19** Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint. ^proverbs-25-19

**20** As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart. ^proverbs-25-20

**21** If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink: ^proverbs-25-21

**22** For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee. ^proverbs-25-22

**23** The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue. ^proverbs-25-23

**24** It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house. ^proverbs-25-24

**25** As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country. ^proverbs-25-25

**26** A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring. ^proverbs-25-26

**27** It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory. ^proverbs-25-27

**28** He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls. ^proverbs-25-28
