# Proverbs 28

**1** The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion. ^proverbs-28-1

**2** For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged. ^proverbs-28-2

**3** A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food. ^proverbs-28-3

**4** They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them. ^proverbs-28-4

**5** Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all things. ^proverbs-28-5

**6** Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich. ^proverbs-28-6

**7** Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father. ^proverbs-28-7

**8** He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor. ^proverbs-28-8

**9** He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination. ^proverbs-28-9

**10** Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good things in possession. ^proverbs-28-10

**11** The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out. ^proverbs-28-11

**12** When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden. ^proverbs-28-12

**13** He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy. ^proverbs-28-13

**14** Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief. ^proverbs-28-14

**15** As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over the poor people. ^proverbs-28-15

**16** The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor: but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days. ^proverbs-28-16

**17** A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him. ^proverbs-28-17

**18** Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once. ^proverbs-28-18

**19** He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough. ^proverbs-28-19

**20** A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent. ^proverbs-28-20

**21** To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of bread that man will transgress. ^proverbs-28-21

**22** He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him. ^proverbs-28-22

**23** He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue. ^proverbs-28-23

**24** Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer. ^proverbs-28-24

**25** He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat. ^proverbs-28-25

**26** He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered. ^proverbs-28-26

**27** He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse. ^proverbs-28-27

**28** When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase. ^proverbs-28-28
