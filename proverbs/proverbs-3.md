# Proverbs 3

**1** My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments: ^proverbs-3-1

**2** For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee. ^proverbs-3-2

**3** Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart: ^proverbs-3-3

**4** So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man. ^proverbs-3-4

**5** Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. ^proverbs-3-5

**6** In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. ^proverbs-3-6

**7** Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil. ^proverbs-3-7

**8** It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones. ^proverbs-3-8

**9** Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: ^proverbs-3-9

**10** So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine. ^proverbs-3-10

**11** My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction: ^proverbs-3-11

**12** For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth. ^proverbs-3-12

**13** Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding. ^proverbs-3-13

**14** For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. ^proverbs-3-14

**15** She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her. ^proverbs-3-15

**16** Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour. ^proverbs-3-16

**17** Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. ^proverbs-3-17

**18** She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her. ^proverbs-3-18

**19** The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens. ^proverbs-3-19

**20** By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew. ^proverbs-3-20

**21** My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion: ^proverbs-3-21

**22** So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck. ^proverbs-3-22

**23** Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble. ^proverbs-3-23

**24** When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet. ^proverbs-3-24

**25** Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh. ^proverbs-3-25

**26** For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken. ^proverbs-3-26

**27** Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it. ^proverbs-3-27

**28** Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee. ^proverbs-3-28

**29** Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee. ^proverbs-3-29

**30** Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm. ^proverbs-3-30

**31** Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways. ^proverbs-3-31

**32** For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous. ^proverbs-3-32

**33** The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just. ^proverbs-3-33

**34** Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly. ^proverbs-3-34

**35** The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools. ^proverbs-3-35
