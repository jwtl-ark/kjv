# Proverbs 26

**1** As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool. ^proverbs-26-1

**2** As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come. ^proverbs-26-2

**3** A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool’s back. ^proverbs-26-3

**4** Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him. ^proverbs-26-4

**5** Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit. ^proverbs-26-5

**6** He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, and drinketh damage. ^proverbs-26-6

**7** The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the mouth of fools. ^proverbs-26-7

**8** As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth honour to a fool. ^proverbs-26-8

**9** As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouth of fools. ^proverbs-26-9

**10** The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors. ^proverbs-26-10

**11** As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his folly. ^proverbs-26-11

**12** Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool than of him. ^proverbs-26-12

**13** The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets. ^proverbs-26-13

**14** As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed. ^proverbs-26-14

**15** The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth. ^proverbs-26-15

**16** The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason. ^proverbs-26-16

**17** He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears. ^proverbs-26-17

**18** As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death, ^proverbs-26-18

**19** So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport? ^proverbs-26-19

**20** Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth. ^proverbs-26-20

**21** As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife. ^proverbs-26-21

**22** The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly. ^proverbs-26-22

**23** Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross. ^proverbs-26-23

**24** He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him; ^proverbs-26-24

**25** When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart. ^proverbs-26-25

**26** Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the whole congregation. ^proverbs-26-26

**27** Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him. ^proverbs-26-27

**28** A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin. ^proverbs-26-28
