# Proverbs 9

**1** Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars: ^proverbs-9-1

**2** She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table. ^proverbs-9-2

**3** She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city, ^proverbs-9-3

**4** Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, ^proverbs-9-4

**5** Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled. ^proverbs-9-5

**6** Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding. ^proverbs-9-6

**7** He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot. ^proverbs-9-7

**8** Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee. ^proverbs-9-8

**9** Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning. ^proverbs-9-9

**10** The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding. ^proverbs-9-10

**11** For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased. ^proverbs-9-11

**12** If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it. ^proverbs-9-12

**13** A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing. ^proverbs-9-13

**14** For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city, ^proverbs-9-14

**15** To call passengers who go right on their ways: ^proverbs-9-15

**16** Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, ^proverbs-9-16

**17** Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant. ^proverbs-9-17

**18** But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell. ^proverbs-9-18
