# Proverbs 23

**1** When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before thee: ^proverbs-23-1

**2** And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite. ^proverbs-23-2

**3** Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat. ^proverbs-23-3

**4** Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom. ^proverbs-23-4

**5** Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven. ^proverbs-23-5

**6** Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats: ^proverbs-23-6

**7** For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee. ^proverbs-23-7

**8** The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words. ^proverbs-23-8

**9** Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words. ^proverbs-23-9

**10** Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless: ^proverbs-23-10

**11** For their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee. ^proverbs-23-11

**12** Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge. ^proverbs-23-12

**13** Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die. ^proverbs-23-13

**14** Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell. ^proverbs-23-14

**15** My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine. ^proverbs-23-15

**16** Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things. ^proverbs-23-16

**17** Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of the LORD all the day long. ^proverbs-23-17

**18** For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off. ^proverbs-23-18

**19** Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way. ^proverbs-23-19

**20** Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh: ^proverbs-23-20

**21** For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags. ^proverbs-23-21

**22** Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old. ^proverbs-23-22

**23** Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding. ^proverbs-23-23

**24** The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him. ^proverbs-23-24

**25** Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice. ^proverbs-23-25

**26** My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways. ^proverbs-23-26

**27** For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow pit. ^proverbs-23-27

**28** She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men. ^proverbs-23-28

**29** Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes? ^proverbs-23-29

**30** They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine. ^proverbs-23-30

**31** Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright. ^proverbs-23-31

**32** At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder. ^proverbs-23-32

**33** Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things. ^proverbs-23-33

**34** Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast. ^proverbs-23-34

**35** They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again. ^proverbs-23-35
