# Proverbs 7

**1** My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee. ^proverbs-7-1

**2** Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye. ^proverbs-7-2

**3** Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart. ^proverbs-7-3

**4** Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman: ^proverbs-7-4

**5** That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words. ^proverbs-7-5

**6** For at the window of my house I looked through my casement, ^proverbs-7-6

**7** And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding, ^proverbs-7-7

**8** Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house, ^proverbs-7-8

**9** In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night: ^proverbs-7-9

**10** And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart. ^proverbs-7-10

**11** (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house: ^proverbs-7-11

**12** Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.) ^proverbs-7-12

**13** So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him, ^proverbs-7-13

**14** I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows. ^proverbs-7-14

**15** Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee. ^proverbs-7-15

**16** I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt. ^proverbs-7-16

**17** I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. ^proverbs-7-17

**18** Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves. ^proverbs-7-18

**19** For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey: ^proverbs-7-19

**20** He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed. ^proverbs-7-20

**21** With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him. ^proverbs-7-21

**22** He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks; ^proverbs-7-22

**23** Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life. ^proverbs-7-23

**24** Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth. ^proverbs-7-24

**25** Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths. ^proverbs-7-25

**26** For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her. ^proverbs-7-26

**27** Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death. ^proverbs-7-27
