# Proverbs 31

**1** The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him. ^proverbs-31-1

**2** What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows? ^proverbs-31-2

**3** Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings. ^proverbs-31-3

**4** It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink: ^proverbs-31-4

**5** Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted. ^proverbs-31-5

**6** Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts. ^proverbs-31-6

**7** Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more. ^proverbs-31-7

**8** Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction. ^proverbs-31-8

**9** Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy. ^proverbs-31-9

**10** Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies. ^proverbs-31-10

**11** The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil. ^proverbs-31-11

**12** She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life. ^proverbs-31-12

**13** She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands. ^proverbs-31-13

**14** She is like the merchants’ ships; she bringeth her food from afar. ^proverbs-31-14

**15** She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens. ^proverbs-31-15

**16** She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. ^proverbs-31-16

**17** She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms. ^proverbs-31-17

**18** She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night. ^proverbs-31-18

**19** She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff. ^proverbs-31-19

**20** She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. ^proverbs-31-20

**21** She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet. ^proverbs-31-21

**22** She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple. ^proverbs-31-22

**23** Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land. ^proverbs-31-23

**24** She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant. ^proverbs-31-24

**25** Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come. ^proverbs-31-25

**26** She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. ^proverbs-31-26

**27** She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. ^proverbs-31-27

**28** Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her. ^proverbs-31-28

**29** Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all. ^proverbs-31-29

**30** Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised. ^proverbs-31-30

**31** Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates. ^proverbs-31-31
