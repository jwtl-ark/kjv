# Proverbs 2

**1** My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee; ^proverbs-2-1

**2** So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding; ^proverbs-2-2

**3** Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding; ^proverbs-2-3

**4** If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures; ^proverbs-2-4

**5** Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God. ^proverbs-2-5

**6** For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding. ^proverbs-2-6

**7** He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly. ^proverbs-2-7

**8** He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints. ^proverbs-2-8

**9** Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path. ^proverbs-2-9

**10** When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul; ^proverbs-2-10

**11** Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee: ^proverbs-2-11

**12** To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things; ^proverbs-2-12

**13** Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; ^proverbs-2-13

**14** Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked; ^proverbs-2-14

**15** Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths: ^proverbs-2-15

**16** To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words; ^proverbs-2-16

**17** Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God. ^proverbs-2-17

**18** For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead. ^proverbs-2-18

**19** None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life. ^proverbs-2-19

**20** That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous. ^proverbs-2-20

**21** For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it. ^proverbs-2-21

**22** But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it. ^proverbs-2-22
