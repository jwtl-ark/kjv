# Proverbs 19

**1** Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool. ^proverbs-19-1

**2** Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth. ^proverbs-19-2

**3** The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD. ^proverbs-19-3

**4** Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour. ^proverbs-19-4

**5** A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape. ^proverbs-19-5

**6** Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts. ^proverbs-19-6

**7** All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him. ^proverbs-19-7

**8** He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good. ^proverbs-19-8

**9** A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish. ^proverbs-19-9

**10** Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes. ^proverbs-19-10

**11** The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression. ^proverbs-19-11

**12** The king’s wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as dew upon the grass. ^proverbs-19-12

**13** A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping. ^proverbs-19-13

**14** House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife is from the LORD. ^proverbs-19-14

**15** Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger. ^proverbs-19-15

**16** He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he that despiseth his ways shall die. ^proverbs-19-16

**17** He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again. ^proverbs-19-17

**18** Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying. ^proverbs-19-18

**19** A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again. ^proverbs-19-19

**20** Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end. ^proverbs-19-20

**21** There are many devices in a man’s heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand. ^proverbs-19-21

**22** The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better than a liar. ^proverbs-19-22

**23** The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil. ^proverbs-19-23

**24** A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. ^proverbs-19-24

**25** Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge. ^proverbs-19-25

**26** He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach. ^proverbs-19-26

**27** Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge. ^proverbs-19-27

**28** An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity. ^proverbs-19-28

**29** Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools. ^proverbs-19-29
