# Proverbs 8

**1** Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice? ^proverbs-8-1

**2** She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths. ^proverbs-8-2

**3** She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors. ^proverbs-8-3

**4** Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man. ^proverbs-8-4

**5** O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart. ^proverbs-8-5

**6** Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things. ^proverbs-8-6

**7** For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips. ^proverbs-8-7

**8** All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing froward or perverse in them. ^proverbs-8-8

**9** They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge. ^proverbs-8-9

**10** Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold. ^proverbs-8-10

**11** For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it. ^proverbs-8-11

**12** I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions. ^proverbs-8-12

**13** The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate. ^proverbs-8-13

**14** Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength. ^proverbs-8-14

**15** By me kings reign, and princes decree justice. ^proverbs-8-15

**16** By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth. ^proverbs-8-16

**17** I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me. ^proverbs-8-17

**18** Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness. ^proverbs-8-18

**19** My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver. ^proverbs-8-19

**20** I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment: ^proverbs-8-20

**21** That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures. ^proverbs-8-21

**22** The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. ^proverbs-8-22

**23** I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was. ^proverbs-8-23

**24** When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water. ^proverbs-8-24

**25** Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth: ^proverbs-8-25

**26** While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world. ^proverbs-8-26

**27** When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth: ^proverbs-8-27

**28** When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep: ^proverbs-8-28

**29** When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth: ^proverbs-8-29

**30** Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him; ^proverbs-8-30

**31** Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men. ^proverbs-8-31

**32** Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways. ^proverbs-8-32

**33** Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not. ^proverbs-8-33

**34** Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors. ^proverbs-8-34

**35** For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD. ^proverbs-8-35

**36** But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death. ^proverbs-8-36
