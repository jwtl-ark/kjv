# Proverbs 22

**1** A GOOD name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and loving favour rather than silver and gold. ^proverbs-22-1

**2** The rich and poor meet together: the LORD is the maker of them all. ^proverbs-22-2

**3** A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished. ^proverbs-22-3

**4** By humility and the fear of the LORD are riches, and honour, and life. ^proverbs-22-4

**5** Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward: he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them. ^proverbs-22-5

**6** Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it. ^proverbs-22-6

**7** The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender. ^proverbs-22-7

**8** He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his anger shall fail. ^proverbs-22-8

**9** He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his bread to the poor. ^proverbs-22-9

**10** Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife and reproach shall cease. ^proverbs-22-10

**11** He that loveth pureness of heart, for the grace of his lips the king shall be his friend. ^proverbs-22-11

**12** The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor. ^proverbs-22-12

**13** The slothful man saith, There is a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets. ^proverbs-22-13

**14** The mouth of strange women is a deep pit: he that is abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein. ^proverbs-22-14

**15** Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him. ^proverbs-22-15

**16** He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches, and he that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want. ^proverbs-22-16

**17** Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge. ^proverbs-22-17

**18** For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they shall withal be fitted in thy lips. ^proverbs-22-18

**19** That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee this day, even to thee. ^proverbs-22-19

**20** Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge, ^proverbs-22-20

**21** That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee? ^proverbs-22-21

**22** Rob not the poor, because he is poor: neither oppress the afflicted in the gate: ^proverbs-22-22

**23** For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them. ^proverbs-22-23

**24** Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go: ^proverbs-22-24

**25** Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul. ^proverbs-22-25

**26** Be not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them that are sureties for debts. ^proverbs-22-26

**27** If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee? ^proverbs-22-27

**28** Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set. ^proverbs-22-28

**29** Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men. ^proverbs-22-29
