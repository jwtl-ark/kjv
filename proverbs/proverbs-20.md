# Proverbs 20

**1** Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise. ^proverbs-20-1

**2** The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul. ^proverbs-20-2

**3** It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling. ^proverbs-20-3

**4** The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing. ^proverbs-20-4

**5** Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out. ^proverbs-20-5

**6** Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find? ^proverbs-20-6

**7** The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are blessed after him. ^proverbs-20-7

**8** A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes. ^proverbs-20-8

**9** Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin? ^proverbs-20-9

**10** Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike abomination to the LORD. ^proverbs-20-10

**11** Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right. ^proverbs-20-11

**13** Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread. ^proverbs-20-13

**14** It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth. ^proverbs-20-14

**15** There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel. ^proverbs-20-15

**16** Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman. ^proverbs-20-16

**17** Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel. ^proverbs-20-17

**18** Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war. ^proverbs-20-18

**19** He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips. ^proverbs-20-19

**20** Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness. ^proverbs-20-20

**21** An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed. ^proverbs-20-21

**22** Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee. ^proverbs-20-22

**23** Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance is not good. ^proverbs-20-23

**24** Man’s goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way? ^proverbs-20-24

**25** It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after vows to make enquiry. ^proverbs-20-25

**26** A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them. ^proverbs-20-26

**27** The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly. ^proverbs-20-27

**28** Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy. ^proverbs-20-28

**29** The glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of old men is the grey head. ^proverbs-20-29

**30** The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the inward parts of the belly. ^proverbs-20-30
