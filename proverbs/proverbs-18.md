# Proverbs 18

**1** Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom. ^proverbs-18-1

**2** A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself. ^proverbs-18-2

**3** When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach. ^proverbs-18-3

**4** The words of a man’s mouth are as deep waters, and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook. ^proverbs-18-4

**5** It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment. ^proverbs-18-5

**6** A fool’s lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes. ^proverbs-18-6

**7** A fool’s mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul. ^proverbs-18-7

**8** The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly. ^proverbs-18-8

**9** He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster. ^proverbs-18-9

**10** The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe. ^proverbs-18-10

**11** The rich man’s wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit. ^proverbs-18-11

**12** Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility. ^proverbs-18-12

**13** He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him. ^proverbs-18-13

**14** The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear? ^proverbs-18-14

**15** The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge. ^proverbs-18-15

**16** A man’s gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men. ^proverbs-18-16

**17** He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him. ^proverbs-18-17

**18** The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty. ^proverbs-18-18

**19** A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle. ^proverbs-18-19

**20** A man’s belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled. ^proverbs-18-20

**21** Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof. ^proverbs-18-21

**22** Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD. ^proverbs-18-22

**23** The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly. ^proverbs-18-23

**24** A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother. ^proverbs-18-24
