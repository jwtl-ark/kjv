# Proverbs 5

**1** My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding: ^proverbs-5-1

**2** That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge. ^proverbs-5-2

**3** For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil: ^proverbs-5-3

**4** But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. ^proverbs-5-4

**5** Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell. ^proverbs-5-5

**6** Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them. ^proverbs-5-6

**7** Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth. ^proverbs-5-7

**8** Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house: ^proverbs-5-8

**9** Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel: ^proverbs-5-9

**10** Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger; ^proverbs-5-10

**11** And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed, ^proverbs-5-11

**12** And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof; ^proverbs-5-12

**13** And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me! ^proverbs-5-13

**14** I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly. ^proverbs-5-14

**15** Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well. ^proverbs-5-15

**16** Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets. ^proverbs-5-16

**17** Let them be only thine own, and not strangers’ with thee. ^proverbs-5-17

**18** Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. ^proverbs-5-18

**19** Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love. ^proverbs-5-19

**20** And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger? ^proverbs-5-20

**21** For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings. ^proverbs-5-21

**22** His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins. ^proverbs-5-22

**23** He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray. ^proverbs-5-23
