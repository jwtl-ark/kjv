# Proverbs 6

**1** My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger, ^proverbs-6-1

**2** Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth. ^proverbs-6-2

**3** Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend. ^proverbs-6-3

**4** Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids. ^proverbs-6-4

**5** Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler. ^proverbs-6-5

**6** Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise: ^proverbs-6-6

**7** Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler, ^proverbs-6-7

**8** Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest. ^proverbs-6-8

**9** How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep? ^proverbs-6-9

**10** Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: ^proverbs-6-10

**11** So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man. ^proverbs-6-11

**12** A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth. ^proverbs-6-12

**13** He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers; ^proverbs-6-13

**14** Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord. ^proverbs-6-14

**15** Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy. ^proverbs-6-15

**16** These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him: ^proverbs-6-16

**17** A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, ^proverbs-6-17

**18** An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, ^proverbs-6-18

**19** A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren. ^proverbs-6-19

**20** My son, keep thy father’s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother: ^proverbs-6-20

**21** Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck. ^proverbs-6-21

**22** When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. ^proverbs-6-22

**23** For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life: ^proverbs-6-23

**24** To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. ^proverbs-6-24

**25** Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids. ^proverbs-6-25

**26** For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life. ^proverbs-6-26

**27** Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? ^proverbs-6-27

**28** Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned? ^proverbs-6-28

**29** So he that goeth in to his neighbour’s wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent. ^proverbs-6-29

**30** Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry; ^proverbs-6-30

**31** But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house. ^proverbs-6-31

**32** But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul. ^proverbs-6-32

**33** A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away. ^proverbs-6-33

**34** For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance. ^proverbs-6-34

**35** He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts. ^proverbs-6-35
