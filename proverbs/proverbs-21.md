# Proverbs 21

**1** The king’s heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will. ^proverbs-21-1

**2** Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts. ^proverbs-21-2

**3** To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice. ^proverbs-21-3

**4** An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked, is sin. ^proverbs-21-4

**5** The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but of every one that is hasty only to want. ^proverbs-21-5

**6** The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death. ^proverbs-21-6

**7** The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment. ^proverbs-21-7

**8** The way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure, his work is right. ^proverbs-21-8

**9** It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house. ^proverbs-21-9

**10** The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes. ^proverbs-21-10

**11** When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge. ^proverbs-21-11

**12** The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked: but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness. ^proverbs-21-12

**13** Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard. ^proverbs-21-13

**14** A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath. ^proverbs-21-14

**15** It is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity. ^proverbs-21-15

**16** The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead. ^proverbs-21-16

**17** He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich. ^proverbs-21-17

**18** The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright. ^proverbs-21-18

**19** It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman. ^proverbs-21-19

**20** There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up. ^proverbs-21-20

**21** He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour. ^proverbs-21-21

**22** A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof. ^proverbs-21-22

**23** Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles. ^proverbs-21-23

**24** Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud wrath. ^proverbs-21-24

**25** The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour. ^proverbs-21-25

**26** He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not. ^proverbs-21-26

**27** The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind? ^proverbs-21-27

**28** A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly. ^proverbs-21-28

**29** A wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the upright, he directeth his way. ^proverbs-21-29

**30** There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD. ^proverbs-21-30

**31** The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is of the LORD. ^proverbs-21-31
