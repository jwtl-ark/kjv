# 1 Thessalonians 5

**1** But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you. ^1-thessalonians-5-1

**2** For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. ^1-thessalonians-5-2

**3** For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape. ^1-thessalonians-5-3

**4** But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. ^1-thessalonians-5-4

**5** Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness. ^1-thessalonians-5-5

**6** Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober. ^1-thessalonians-5-6

**7** For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night. ^1-thessalonians-5-7

**8** But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation. ^1-thessalonians-5-8

**9** For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, ^1-thessalonians-5-9

**10** Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. ^1-thessalonians-5-10

**11** Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do. ^1-thessalonians-5-11

**12** And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; ^1-thessalonians-5-12

**13** And to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake. And be at peace among yourselves. ^1-thessalonians-5-13

**14** Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men. ^1-thessalonians-5-14

**15** See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men. ^1-thessalonians-5-15

**16** Rejoice evermore. ^1-thessalonians-5-16

**17** Pray without ceasing. ^1-thessalonians-5-17

**18** In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. ^1-thessalonians-5-18

**19** Quench not the Spirit. ^1-thessalonians-5-19

**20** Despise not prophesyings. ^1-thessalonians-5-20

**21** Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. ^1-thessalonians-5-21

**22** Abstain from all appearance of evil. ^1-thessalonians-5-22

**23** And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. ^1-thessalonians-5-23

**24** Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it. ^1-thessalonians-5-24

**25** Brethren, pray for us. ^1-thessalonians-5-25

**26** Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss. ^1-thessalonians-5-26

**27** I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren. ^1-thessalonians-5-27

**28** The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. ^1-thessalonians-5-28
