# Psalms 38

**1** O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. ^psalms-38-1

**2** For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore. ^psalms-38-2

**3** There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin. ^psalms-38-3

**4** For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me. ^psalms-38-4

**5** My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness. ^psalms-38-5

**6** I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long. ^psalms-38-6

**7** For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh. ^psalms-38-7

**8** I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart. ^psalms-38-8

**9** Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee. ^psalms-38-9

**10** My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me. ^psalms-38-10

**11** My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off. ^psalms-38-11

**12** They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long. ^psalms-38-12

**13** But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth. ^psalms-38-13

**14** Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs. ^psalms-38-14

**15** For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God. ^psalms-38-15

**16** For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me. ^psalms-38-16

**17** For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me. ^psalms-38-17

**18** For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin. ^psalms-38-18

**19** But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied. ^psalms-38-19

**20** They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is. ^psalms-38-20

**21** Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me. ^psalms-38-21

**22** Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation. ^psalms-38-22
