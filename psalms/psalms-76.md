# Psalms 76

**1** In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel. ^psalms-76-1

**2** In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion. ^psalms-76-2

**3** There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah. ^psalms-76-3

**4** Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey. ^psalms-76-4

**5** The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands. ^psalms-76-5

**6** At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep. ^psalms-76-6

**7** Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry? ^psalms-76-7

**8** Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still, ^psalms-76-8

**9** When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah. ^psalms-76-9

**10** Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain. ^psalms-76-10

**11** Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared. ^psalms-76-11

**12** He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth. ^psalms-76-12
