# Psalms 103

**1** Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name. ^psalms-103-1

**2** Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: ^psalms-103-2

**3** Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; ^psalms-103-3

**4** Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies; ^psalms-103-4

**5** Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle’s. ^psalms-103-5

**6** The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed. ^psalms-103-6

**7** He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel. ^psalms-103-7

**8** The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. ^psalms-103-8

**9** He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever. ^psalms-103-9

**10** He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. ^psalms-103-10

**11** For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him. ^psalms-103-11

**12** As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us. ^psalms-103-12

**13** Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him. ^psalms-103-13

**14** For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. ^psalms-103-14

**15** As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. ^psalms-103-15

**16** For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more. ^psalms-103-16

**17** But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children’s children; ^psalms-103-17

**18** To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them. ^psalms-103-18

**19** The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all. ^psalms-103-19

**20** Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word. ^psalms-103-20

**21** Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure. ^psalms-103-21

**22** Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul. ^psalms-103-22
