# Psalms 131

**1** Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me. ^psalms-131-1

**2** Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child. ^psalms-131-2

**3** Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever. ^psalms-131-3
