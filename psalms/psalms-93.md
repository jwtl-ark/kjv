# Psalms 93

**1** The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved. ^psalms-93-1

**2** Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting. ^psalms-93-2

**3** The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves. ^psalms-93-3

**4** The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea. ^psalms-93-4

**5** Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever. ^psalms-93-5
