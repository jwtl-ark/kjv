# Psalms 129

**1** Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say: ^psalms-129-1

**2** Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me. ^psalms-129-2

**3** The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows. ^psalms-129-3

**4** The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked. ^psalms-129-4

**5** Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion. ^psalms-129-5

**6** Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up: ^psalms-129-6

**7** Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom. ^psalms-129-7

**8** Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD. ^psalms-129-8
