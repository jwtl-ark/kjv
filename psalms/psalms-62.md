# Psalms 62

**1** Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation. ^psalms-62-1

**2** He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved. ^psalms-62-2

**3** How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence. ^psalms-62-3

**4** They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah. ^psalms-62-4

**5** My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him. ^psalms-62-5

**6** He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved. ^psalms-62-6

**7** In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God. ^psalms-62-7

**8** Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah. ^psalms-62-8

**9** Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity. ^psalms-62-9

**10** Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them. ^psalms-62-10

**11** God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God. ^psalms-62-11

**12** Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work. ^psalms-62-12
