# Psalms 143

**1** Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness. ^psalms-143-1

**2** And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified. ^psalms-143-2

**3** For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead. ^psalms-143-3

**4** Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate. ^psalms-143-4

**5** I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands. ^psalms-143-5

**6** I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah. ^psalms-143-6

**7** Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit. ^psalms-143-7

**8** Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee. ^psalms-143-8

**9** Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me. ^psalms-143-9

**10** Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness. ^psalms-143-10

**11** Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name’s sake: for thy righteousness’ sake bring my soul out of trouble. ^psalms-143-11

**12** And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant. ^psalms-143-12
