# Psalms 58

**1** Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men? ^psalms-58-1

**2** Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth. ^psalms-58-2

**3** The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies. ^psalms-58-3

**4** Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear; ^psalms-58-4

**5** Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely. ^psalms-58-5

**6** Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD. ^psalms-58-6

**7** Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces. ^psalms-58-7

**8** As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun. ^psalms-58-8

**9** Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath. ^psalms-58-9

**10** The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked. ^psalms-58-10

**11** So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth. ^psalms-58-11
