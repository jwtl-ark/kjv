# Psalms 12

**1** Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men. ^psalms-12-1

**2** They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak. ^psalms-12-2

**3** The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things: ^psalms-12-3

**4** Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us? ^psalms-12-4

**5** For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him. ^psalms-12-5

**6** The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. ^psalms-12-6

**7** Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever. ^psalms-12-7

**8** The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted. ^psalms-12-8
