# Psalms 114

**1** When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language; ^psalms-114-1

**2** Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion. ^psalms-114-2

**3** The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back. ^psalms-114-3

**4** The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs. ^psalms-114-4

**5** What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back? ^psalms-114-5

**6** Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs? ^psalms-114-6

**7** Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob; ^psalms-114-7

**8** Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters. ^psalms-114-8
