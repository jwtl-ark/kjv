**1** O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. ^psalms-95-1

**2** Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms. ^psalms-95-2

**3** For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods. ^psalms-95-3

**4** In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills is his also. ^psalms-95-4

**5** The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land. ^psalms-95-5

**6** O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker. ^psalms-95-6

**7** For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice, ^psalms-95-7

**8** Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness: ^psalms-95-8

**9** When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work. ^psalms-95-9

**10** Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways: ^psalms-95-10

**11** Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest. ^psalms-95-11
