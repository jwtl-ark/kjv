# Psalms 17

**1** Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips. ^psalms-17-1

**2** Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal. ^psalms-17-2

**3** Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress. ^psalms-17-3

**4** Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer. ^psalms-17-4

**5** Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not. ^psalms-17-5

**6** I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech. ^psalms-17-6

**7** Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them. ^psalms-17-7

**8** Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings, ^psalms-17-8

**9** From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about. ^psalms-17-9

**10** They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly. ^psalms-17-10

**11** They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth; ^psalms-17-11

**12** Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places. ^psalms-17-12

**13** Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword: ^psalms-17-13

**14** From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes. ^psalms-17-14

**15** As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness. ^psalms-17-15
