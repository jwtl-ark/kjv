# Psalms 74

**1** O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture? ^psalms-74-1

**2** Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt. ^psalms-74-2

**3** Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary. ^psalms-74-3

**4** Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs. ^psalms-74-4

**5** A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees. ^psalms-74-5

**6** But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers. ^psalms-74-6

**7** They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground. ^psalms-74-7

**8** They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land. ^psalms-74-8

**9** We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knoweth how long. ^psalms-74-9

**10** O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever? ^psalms-74-10

**11** Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy bosom. ^psalms-74-11

**12** For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth. ^psalms-74-12

**13** Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters. ^psalms-74-13

**14** Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness. ^psalms-74-14

**15** Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers. ^psalms-74-15

**16** The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun. ^psalms-74-16

**17** Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter. ^psalms-74-17

**18** Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name. ^psalms-74-18

**19** O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever. ^psalms-74-19

**20** Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty. ^psalms-74-20

**21** O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name. ^psalms-74-21

**22** Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily. ^psalms-74-22

**23** Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually. ^psalms-74-23
