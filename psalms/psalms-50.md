# Psalms 50

**1** The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof. ^psalms-50-1

**2** Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined. ^psalms-50-2

**3** Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him. ^psalms-50-3

**4** He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people. ^psalms-50-4

**5** Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice. ^psalms-50-5

**6** And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself. Selah. ^psalms-50-6

**7** Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I am God, even thy God. ^psalms-50-7

**8** I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, to have been continually before me. ^psalms-50-8

**9** I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy folds. ^psalms-50-9

**10** For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. ^psalms-50-10

**11** I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine. ^psalms-50-11

**12** If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof. ^psalms-50-12

**13** Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? ^psalms-50-13

**14** Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High: ^psalms-50-14

**15** And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me. ^psalms-50-15

**16** But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth? ^psalms-50-16

**17** Seeing thou hatest instruction, and casteth my words behind thee. ^psalms-50-17

**18** When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers. ^psalms-50-18

**19** Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit. ^psalms-50-19

**20** Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother’s son. ^psalms-50-20

**21** These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes. ^psalms-50-21

**22** Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver. ^psalms-50-22

**23** Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God. ^psalms-50-23
