# Psalms 26

**1** Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide. ^psalms-26-1

**2** Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart. ^psalms-26-2

**3** For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth. ^psalms-26-3

**4** I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers. ^psalms-26-4

**5** I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked. ^psalms-26-5

**6** I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O LORD: ^psalms-26-6

**7** That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works. ^psalms-26-7

**8** LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth. ^psalms-26-8

**9** Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men: ^psalms-26-9

**10** In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes. ^psalms-26-10

**11** But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me. ^psalms-26-11

**12** My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD. ^psalms-26-12
