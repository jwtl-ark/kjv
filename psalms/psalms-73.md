# Psalms 73

**1** Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart. ^psalms-73-1

**2** But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped. ^psalms-73-2

**3** For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. ^psalms-73-3

**4** For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm. ^psalms-73-4

**5** They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men. ^psalms-73-5

**6** Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment. ^psalms-73-6

**7** Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish. ^psalms-73-7

**8** They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily. ^psalms-73-8

**9** They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth. ^psalms-73-9

**10** Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them. ^psalms-73-10

**11** And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High? ^psalms-73-11

**12** Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches. ^psalms-73-12

**13** Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency. ^psalms-73-13

**14** For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning. ^psalms-73-14

**15** If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children. ^psalms-73-15

**16** When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me; ^psalms-73-16

**17** Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end. ^psalms-73-17

**18** Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction. ^psalms-73-18

**19** How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors. ^psalms-73-19

**20** As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image. ^psalms-73-20

**21** Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins. ^psalms-73-21

**22** So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee. ^psalms-73-22

**23** Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand. ^psalms-73-23

**24** Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory. ^psalms-73-24

**25** Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee. ^psalms-73-25

**26** My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever. ^psalms-73-26

**27** For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee. ^psalms-73-27

**28** But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works. ^psalms-73-28
