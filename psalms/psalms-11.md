# Psalms 11

**1** In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain? ^psalms-11-1

**2** For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart. ^psalms-11-2

**3** If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do? ^psalms-11-3

**4** The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD’s throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men. ^psalms-11-4

**5** The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth. ^psalms-11-5

**6** Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup. ^psalms-11-6

**7** For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright. ^psalms-11-7
