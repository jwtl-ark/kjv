# Psalms 102

**1** Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee. ^psalms-102-1

**2** Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily. ^psalms-102-2

**3** For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth. ^psalms-102-3

**4** My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread. ^psalms-102-4

**5** By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin. ^psalms-102-5

**6** I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert. ^psalms-102-6

**7** I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top. ^psalms-102-7

**8** Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me. ^psalms-102-8

**9** For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping, ^psalms-102-9

**10** Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down. ^psalms-102-10

**11** My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass. ^psalms-102-11

**12** But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations. ^psalms-102-12

**13** Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come. ^psalms-102-13

**14** For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof. ^psalms-102-14

**15** So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory. ^psalms-102-15

**16** When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory. ^psalms-102-16

**17** He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer. ^psalms-102-17

**18** This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD. ^psalms-102-18

**19** For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth; ^psalms-102-19

**20** To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death; ^psalms-102-20

**21** To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem; ^psalms-102-21

**22** When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD. ^psalms-102-22

**23** He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days. ^psalms-102-23

**24** I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations. ^psalms-102-24

**25** Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands. ^psalms-102-25

**26** They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: ^psalms-102-26

**27** But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end. ^psalms-102-27

**28** The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee. ^psalms-102-28
