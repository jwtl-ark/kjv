# Psalms 56

**1** Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me. ^psalms-56-1

**2** Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that fight against me, O thou most High. ^psalms-56-2

**3** What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee. ^psalms-56-3

**4** In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me. ^psalms-56-4

**5** Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me for evil. ^psalms-56-5

**6** They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul. ^psalms-56-6

**7** Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the people, O God. ^psalms-56-7

**8** Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book? ^psalms-56-8

**9** When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God is for me. ^psalms-56-9

**10** In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his word. ^psalms-56-10

**11** In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me. ^psalms-56-11

**12** Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee. ^psalms-56-12

**13** For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living? ^psalms-56-13
