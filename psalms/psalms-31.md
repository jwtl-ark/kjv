# Psalms 31

**1** In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness. ^psalms-31-1

**2** Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me. ^psalms-31-2

**3** For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name’s sake lead me, and guide me. ^psalms-31-3

**4** Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my strength. ^psalms-31-4

**5** Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth. ^psalms-31-5

**6** I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD. ^psalms-31-6

**7** I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities; ^psalms-31-7

**8** And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room. ^psalms-31-8

**9** Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly. ^psalms-31-9

**10** For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed. ^psalms-31-10

**11** I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me. ^psalms-31-11

**12** I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel. ^psalms-31-12

**13** For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life. ^psalms-31-13

**14** But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God. ^psalms-31-14

**15** My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me. ^psalms-31-15

**16** Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies’ sake. ^psalms-31-16

**17** Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave. ^psalms-31-17

**18** Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous. ^psalms-31-18

**19** Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men! ^psalms-31-19

**20** Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues. ^psalms-31-20

**21** Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city. ^psalms-31-21

**22** For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee. ^psalms-31-22

**23** O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer. ^psalms-31-23

**24** Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD. ^psalms-31-24
