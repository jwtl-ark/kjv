# Psalms 105

**1** O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people. ^psalms-105-1

**2** Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works. ^psalms-105-2

**3** Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD. ^psalms-105-3

**4** Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore. ^psalms-105-4

**5** Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; ^psalms-105-5

**6** O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen. ^psalms-105-6

**7** He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth. ^psalms-105-7

**8** He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations. ^psalms-105-8

**9** Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac; ^psalms-105-9

**10** And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant: ^psalms-105-10

**11** Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance: ^psalms-105-11

**12** When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it. ^psalms-105-12

**13** When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people; ^psalms-105-13

**14** He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes; ^psalms-105-14

**15** Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. ^psalms-105-15

**16** Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread. ^psalms-105-16

**17** He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant: ^psalms-105-17

**18** Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron: ^psalms-105-18

**19** Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him. ^psalms-105-19

**20** The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free. ^psalms-105-20

**21** He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance: ^psalms-105-21

**22** To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom. ^psalms-105-22

**23** Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. ^psalms-105-23

**24** And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies. ^psalms-105-24

**25** He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants. ^psalms-105-25

**26** He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen. ^psalms-105-26

**27** They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham. ^psalms-105-27

**28** He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word. ^psalms-105-28

**29** He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish. ^psalms-105-29

**30** Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings. ^psalms-105-30

**31** He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts. ^psalms-105-31

**32** He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land. ^psalms-105-32

**33** He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts. ^psalms-105-33

**34** He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number, ^psalms-105-34

**35** And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground. ^psalms-105-35

**36** He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength. ^psalms-105-36

**37** He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes. ^psalms-105-37

**38** Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them. ^psalms-105-38

**39** He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night. ^psalms-105-39

**40** The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. ^psalms-105-40

**41** He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river. ^psalms-105-41

**42** For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant. ^psalms-105-42

**43** And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness: ^psalms-105-43

**44** And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people; ^psalms-105-44

**45** That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD. ^psalms-105-45
