# Psalms 80

**1** Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth. ^psalms-80-1

**2** Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come and save us. ^psalms-80-2

**3** Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. ^psalms-80-3

**4** O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people? ^psalms-80-4

**5** Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure. ^psalms-80-5

**6** Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves. ^psalms-80-6

**7** Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. ^psalms-80-7

**8** Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it. ^psalms-80-8

**9** Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land. ^psalms-80-9

**10** The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars. ^psalms-80-10

**11** She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river. ^psalms-80-11

**12** Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her? ^psalms-80-12

**13** The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it. ^psalms-80-13

**14** Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine; ^psalms-80-14

**15** And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself. ^psalms-80-15

**16** It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance. ^psalms-80-16

**17** Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself. ^psalms-80-17

**18** So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name. ^psalms-80-18

**19** Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. ^psalms-80-19
