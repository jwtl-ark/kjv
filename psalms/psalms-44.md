# Psalms 44

**1** We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old. ^psalms-44-1

**2** How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out. ^psalms-44-2

**3** For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them. ^psalms-44-3

**4** Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob. ^psalms-44-4

**5** Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us. ^psalms-44-5

**6** For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me. ^psalms-44-6

**7** But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us. ^psalms-44-7

**8** In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah. ^psalms-44-8

**9** But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies. ^psalms-44-9

**10** Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves. ^psalms-44-10

**11** Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen. ^psalms-44-11

**12** Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy wealth by their price. ^psalms-44-12

**13** Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us. ^psalms-44-13

**14** Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people. ^psalms-44-14

**15** My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me, ^psalms-44-15

**16** For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger. ^psalms-44-16

**17** All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant. ^psalms-44-17

**18** Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way; ^psalms-44-18

**19** Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death. ^psalms-44-19

**20** If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god; ^psalms-44-20

**21** Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart. ^psalms-44-21

**22** Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter. ^psalms-44-22

**23** Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever. ^psalms-44-23

**24** Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression? ^psalms-44-24

**25** For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth. ^psalms-44-25

**26** Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies’ sake. ^psalms-44-26
