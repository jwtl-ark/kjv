# Psalms 70

**1** MAKE HASTE, O GOD, TO DELIVER ME; MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME, O LORD. ^psalms-70-1

**2** Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt. ^psalms-70-2

**3** Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha. ^psalms-70-3

**4** Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified. ^psalms-70-4

**5** But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying. ^psalms-70-5
