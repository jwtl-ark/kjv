# Psalms 126

**1** When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. ^psalms-126-1

**2** Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them. ^psalms-126-2

**3** The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad. ^psalms-126-3

**4** Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south. ^psalms-126-4

**5** They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. ^psalms-126-5

**6** He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him. ^psalms-126-6
