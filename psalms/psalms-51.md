# Psalms 51

**1** Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. ^psalms-51-1

**2** Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. ^psalms-51-2

**3** For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me. ^psalms-51-3

**4** Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest. ^psalms-51-4

**5** Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me. ^psalms-51-5

**6** Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom. ^psalms-51-6

**7** Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. ^psalms-51-7

**8** Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice. ^psalms-51-8

**9** Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities. ^psalms-51-9

**10** Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me. ^psalms-51-10

**11** Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me. ^psalms-51-11

**12** Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit. ^psalms-51-12

**13** Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee. ^psalms-51-13

**14** Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness. ^psalms-51-14

**15** O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise. ^psalms-51-15

**16** For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt offering. ^psalms-51-16

**17** The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. ^psalms-51-17

**18** Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem. ^psalms-51-18

**19** Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar. ^psalms-51-19
