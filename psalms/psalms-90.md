# Psalms 90

**1** Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations. ^psalms-90-1

**2** Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God. ^psalms-90-2

**3** Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men. ^psalms-90-3

**4** For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night. ^psalms-90-4

**5** Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which groweth up. ^psalms-90-5

**6** In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth. ^psalms-90-6

**7** For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled. ^psalms-90-7

**8** Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance. ^psalms-90-8

**9** For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale that is told. ^psalms-90-9

**10** The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away. ^psalms-90-10

**11** Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath. ^psalms-90-11

**12** So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom. ^psalms-90-12

**13** Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants. ^psalms-90-13

**14** O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days. ^psalms-90-14

**15** Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil. ^psalms-90-15

**16** Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children. ^psalms-90-16

**17** And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it. ^psalms-90-17
