# Psalms 49

**1** Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world: ^psalms-49-1

**2** Both low and high, rich and poor, together. ^psalms-49-2

**3** My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding. ^psalms-49-3

**4** I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp. ^psalms-49-4

**5** Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about? ^psalms-49-5

**6** They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; ^psalms-49-6

**7** None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him: ^psalms-49-7

**8** (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:) ^psalms-49-8

**9** That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption. ^psalms-49-9

**10** For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others. ^psalms-49-10

**11** Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names. ^psalms-49-11

**12** Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish. ^psalms-49-12

**13** This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah. ^psalms-49-13

**14** Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling. ^psalms-49-14

**15** But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah. ^psalms-49-15

**16** Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased; ^psalms-49-16

**17** For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him. ^psalms-49-17

**18** Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself. ^psalms-49-18

**19** He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light. ^psalms-49-19

**20** Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish. ^psalms-49-20
