# Psalms 81

**1** Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob. ^psalms-81-1

**2** Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery. ^psalms-81-2

**3** Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day. ^psalms-81-3

**4** For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob. ^psalms-81-4

**5** This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not. ^psalms-81-5

**6** I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots. ^psalms-81-6

**7** Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah. ^psalms-81-7

**8** Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me; ^psalms-81-8

**9** There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god. ^psalms-81-9

**10** I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it. ^psalms-81-10

**11** But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me. ^psalms-81-11

**12** So I gave them up unto their own hearts’ lust: and they walked in their own counsels. ^psalms-81-12

**13** Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways! ^psalms-81-13

**14** I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries. ^psalms-81-14

**15** The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever. ^psalms-81-15

**16** He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee. ^psalms-81-16
