# Psalms 2

**1** Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? ^psalms-2-1

**2** The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying, ^psalms-2-2

**3** Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. ^psalms-2-3

**4** He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have them in derision. ^psalms-2-4

**5** Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure. ^psalms-2-5

**6** Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. ^psalms-2-6

**7** I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee. ^psalms-2-7

**8** Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. ^psalms-2-8

**9** Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel. ^psalms-2-9

**10** Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. ^psalms-2-10

**11** Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. ^psalms-2-11

**12** Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him. ^psalms-2-12
