# Psalms 107

**1** O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. ^psalms-107-1

**2** Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy; ^psalms-107-2

**3** And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south. ^psalms-107-3

**4** They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in. ^psalms-107-4

**5** Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. ^psalms-107-5

**6** Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses. ^psalms-107-6

**7** And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation. ^psalms-107-7

**8** Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! ^psalms-107-8

**9** For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness. ^psalms-107-9

**10** Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron; ^psalms-107-10

**11** Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High: ^psalms-107-11

**12** Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help. ^psalms-107-12

**13** Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses. ^psalms-107-13

**14** He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder. ^psalms-107-14

**15** Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! ^psalms-107-15

**16** For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder. ^psalms-107-16

**17** Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted. ^psalms-107-17

**18** Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death. ^psalms-107-18

**19** Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses. ^psalms-107-19

**20** He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions. ^psalms-107-20

**21** Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! ^psalms-107-21

**22** And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing. ^psalms-107-22

**23** They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; ^psalms-107-23

**24** These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep. ^psalms-107-24

**25** For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. ^psalms-107-25

**26** They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble. ^psalms-107-26

**27** They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit’s end. ^psalms-107-27

**28** Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. ^psalms-107-28

**29** He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. ^psalms-107-29

**30** Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven. ^psalms-107-30

**31** Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! ^psalms-107-31

**32** Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders. ^psalms-107-32

**33** He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground; ^psalms-107-33

**34** A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein. ^psalms-107-34

**35** He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings. ^psalms-107-35

**36** And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation; ^psalms-107-36

**37** And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase. ^psalms-107-37

**38** He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease. ^psalms-107-38

**39** Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow. ^psalms-107-39

**40** He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way. ^psalms-107-40

**41** Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock. ^psalms-107-41

**42** The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth. ^psalms-107-42

**43** Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD. ^psalms-107-43
