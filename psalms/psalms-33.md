# Psalms 33

**1** Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the upright. ^psalms-33-1

**2** Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings. ^psalms-33-2

**3** Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise. ^psalms-33-3

**4** For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in truth. ^psalms-33-4

**5** He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD. ^psalms-33-5

**6** By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. ^psalms-33-6

**7** He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses. ^psalms-33-7

**8** Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. ^psalms-33-8

**9** For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast. ^psalms-33-9

**10** The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect. ^psalms-33-10

**11** The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations. ^psalms-33-11

**12** Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance. ^psalms-33-12

**13** The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men. ^psalms-33-13

**14** From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth. ^psalms-33-14

**15** He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works. ^psalms-33-15

**16** There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength. ^psalms-33-16

**17** An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great strength. ^psalms-33-17

**18** Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy; ^psalms-33-18

**19** To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine. ^psalms-33-19

**20** Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield. ^psalms-33-20

**21** For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name. ^psalms-33-21

**22** Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee. ^psalms-33-22
