# Psalms 28

**1** Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit. ^psalms-28-1

**2** Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle. ^psalms-28-2

**3** Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in their hearts. ^psalms-28-3

**4** Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert. ^psalms-28-4

**5** Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up. ^psalms-28-5

**6** Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications. ^psalms-28-6

**7** The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him. ^psalms-28-7

**8** The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his anointed. ^psalms-28-8

**9** Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever. ^psalms-28-9
