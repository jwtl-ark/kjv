# Psalms 88

**1** O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee: ^psalms-88-1

**2** Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry; ^psalms-88-2

**3** For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave. ^psalms-88-3

**4** I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man that hath no strength: ^psalms-88-4

**5** Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand. ^psalms-88-5

**6** Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps. ^psalms-88-6

**7** Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah. ^psalms-88-7

**8** Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth. ^psalms-88-8

**9** Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee. ^psalms-88-9

**10** Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise thee? Selah. ^psalms-88-10

**11** Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy faithfulness in destruction? ^psalms-88-11

**12** Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? ^psalms-88-12

**13** But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee. ^psalms-88-13

**14** LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face from me? ^psalms-88-14

**15** I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted. ^psalms-88-15

**16** Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off. ^psalms-88-16

**17** They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together. ^psalms-88-17

**18** Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness. ^psalms-88-18
