# Psalms 19

**1** The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. ^psalms-19-1

**2** Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. ^psalms-19-2

**3** There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. ^psalms-19-3

**4** Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, ^psalms-19-4

**5** Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race. ^psalms-19-5

**6** His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof. ^psalms-19-6

**7** The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple. ^psalms-19-7

**8** The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes. ^psalms-19-8

**9** The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether. ^psalms-19-9

**10** More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. ^psalms-19-10

**11** Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward. ^psalms-19-11

**12** Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults. ^psalms-19-12

**13** Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression. ^psalms-19-13

**14** Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer. ^psalms-19-14
