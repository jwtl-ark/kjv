# Psalms 8

**1** O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens. ^psalms-8-1

**2** Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. ^psalms-8-2

**3** When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; ^psalms-8-3

**4** What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? ^psalms-8-4

**5** For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour. ^psalms-8-5

**6** Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet: ^psalms-8-6

**7** All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field; ^psalms-8-7

**8** The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas. ^psalms-8-8

**9** O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! ^psalms-8-9
