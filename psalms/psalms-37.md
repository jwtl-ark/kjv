# Psalms 37

**1** Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity. ^psalms-37-1

**2** For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb. ^psalms-37-2

**3** Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed. ^psalms-37-3

**4** Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. ^psalms-37-4

**5** Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass. ^psalms-37-5

**6** And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday. ^psalms-37-6

**7** Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. ^psalms-37-7

**8** Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil. ^psalms-37-8

**9** For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth. ^psalms-37-9

**10** For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be. ^psalms-37-10

**11** But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. ^psalms-37-11

**12** The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth. ^psalms-37-12

**13** The LORD shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming. ^psalms-37-13

**14** The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation. ^psalms-37-14

**15** Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken. ^psalms-37-15

**16** A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked. ^psalms-37-16

**17** For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous. ^psalms-37-17

**18** The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever. ^psalms-37-18

**19** They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied. ^psalms-37-19

**20** But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away. ^psalms-37-20

**21** The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth. ^psalms-37-21

**22** For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off. ^psalms-37-22

**23** The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way. ^psalms-37-23

**24** Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand. ^psalms-37-24

**25** I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread. ^psalms-37-25

**26** He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed. ^psalms-37-26

**27** Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore. ^psalms-37-27

**28** For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off. ^psalms-37-28

**29** The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever. ^psalms-37-29

**30** The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment. ^psalms-37-30

**31** The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide. ^psalms-37-31

**32** The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him. ^psalms-37-32

**33** The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged. ^psalms-37-33

**34** Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it. ^psalms-37-34

**35** I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree. ^psalms-37-35

**36** Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found. ^psalms-37-36

**37** Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace. ^psalms-37-37

**38** But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off. ^psalms-37-38

**39** But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their strength in the time of trouble. ^psalms-37-39

**40** And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him. ^psalms-37-40
