# Psalms 132

**1** Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions: ^psalms-132-1

**2** How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob; ^psalms-132-2

**3** Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed; ^psalms-132-3

**4** I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids, ^psalms-132-4

**5** Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob. ^psalms-132-5

**6** Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood. ^psalms-132-6

**7** We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool. ^psalms-132-7

**8** Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength. ^psalms-132-8

**9** Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy. ^psalms-132-9

**10** For thy servant David’s sake turn not away the face of thine anointed. ^psalms-132-10

**11** The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne. ^psalms-132-11

**12** If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore. ^psalms-132-12

**13** For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation. ^psalms-132-13

**14** This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it. ^psalms-132-14

**15** I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread. ^psalms-132-15

**16** I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy. ^psalms-132-16

**17** There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed. ^psalms-132-17

**18** His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish. ^psalms-132-18
