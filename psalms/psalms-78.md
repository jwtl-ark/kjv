# Psalms 78

**1** Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth. ^psalms-78-1

**2** I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old: ^psalms-78-2

**3** Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us. ^psalms-78-3

**4** We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done. ^psalms-78-4

**5** For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children: ^psalms-78-5

**6** That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children: ^psalms-78-6

**7** That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments: ^psalms-78-7

**8** And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God. ^psalms-78-8

**9** The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle. ^psalms-78-9

**10** They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law; ^psalms-78-10

**11** And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them. ^psalms-78-11

**12** Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. ^psalms-78-12

**13** He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap. ^psalms-78-13

**14** In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire. ^psalms-78-14

**15** He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths. ^psalms-78-15

**16** He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers. ^psalms-78-16

**17** And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness. ^psalms-78-17

**18** And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust. ^psalms-78-18

**19** Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? ^psalms-78-19

**20** Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people? ^psalms-78-20

**21** Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel; ^psalms-78-21

**22** Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation: ^psalms-78-22

**23** Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven, ^psalms-78-23

**24** And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven. ^psalms-78-24

**25** Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full. ^psalms-78-25

**26** He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind. ^psalms-78-26

**27** He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea: ^psalms-78-27

**28** And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations. ^psalms-78-28

**29** So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire; ^psalms-78-29

**30** They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths, ^psalms-78-30

**31** The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel. ^psalms-78-31

**32** For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works. ^psalms-78-32

**33** Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble. ^psalms-78-33

**34** When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God. ^psalms-78-34

**35** And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer. ^psalms-78-35

**36** Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues. ^psalms-78-36

**37** For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant. ^psalms-78-37

**38** But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath. ^psalms-78-38

**39** For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. ^psalms-78-39

**40** How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert! ^psalms-78-40

**41** Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel. ^psalms-78-41

**42** They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy. ^psalms-78-42

**43** How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan: ^psalms-78-43

**44** And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink. ^psalms-78-44

**45** He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. ^psalms-78-45

**46** He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust. ^psalms-78-46

**47** He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost. ^psalms-78-47

**48** He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. ^psalms-78-48

**49** He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them. ^psalms-78-49

**50** He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence; ^psalms-78-50

**51** And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham: ^psalms-78-51

**52** But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. ^psalms-78-52

**53** And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. ^psalms-78-53

**54** And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased. ^psalms-78-54

**55** He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. ^psalms-78-55

**56** Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies: ^psalms-78-56

**57** But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow. ^psalms-78-57

**58** For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. ^psalms-78-58

**59** When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel: ^psalms-78-59

**60** So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men; ^psalms-78-60

**61** And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand. ^psalms-78-61

**62** He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance. ^psalms-78-62

**63** The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage. ^psalms-78-63

**64** Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation. ^psalms-78-64

**65** Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. ^psalms-78-65

**66** And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach. ^psalms-78-66

**67** Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: ^psalms-78-67

**68** But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved. ^psalms-78-68

**69** And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever. ^psalms-78-69

**70** He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds: ^psalms-78-70

**71** From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. ^psalms-78-71

**72** So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands. ^psalms-78-72
