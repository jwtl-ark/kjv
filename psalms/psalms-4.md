# Psalms 4

**1** Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer. ^psalms-4-1

**2** O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah. ^psalms-4-2

**3** But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him. ^psalms-4-3

**4** Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah. ^psalms-4-4

**5** Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD. ^psalms-4-5

**6** There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. ^psalms-4-6

**7** Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased. ^psalms-4-7

**8** I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety. ^psalms-4-8
