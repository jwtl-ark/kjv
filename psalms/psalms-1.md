# Psalms 1

**1** Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. ^psalms-1-1

**2** But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. ^psalms-1-2

**3** And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. ^psalms-1-3

**4** The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. ^psalms-1-4

**5** Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. ^psalms-1-5

**6** For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish. ^psalms-1-6
