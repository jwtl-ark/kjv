# Psalms 75

**1** Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare. ^psalms-75-1

**2** When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly. ^psalms-75-2

**3** The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah. ^psalms-75-3

**4** I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn: ^psalms-75-4

**5** Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck. ^psalms-75-5

**6** For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. ^psalms-75-6

**7** But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another. ^psalms-75-7

**8** For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them. ^psalms-75-8

**9** But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. ^psalms-75-9

**10** All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted. ^psalms-75-10
