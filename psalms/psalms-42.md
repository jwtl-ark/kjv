# Psalms 42

**1** As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. ^psalms-42-1

**2** My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God? ^psalms-42-2

**3** My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God? ^psalms-42-3

**4** When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday. ^psalms-42-4

**5** Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance. ^psalms-42-5

**6** O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar. ^psalms-42-6

**7** Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me. ^psalms-42-7

**8** Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day time, and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my life. ^psalms-42-8

**9** I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? ^psalms-42-9

**10** As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where is thy God? ^psalms-42-10

**11** Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God. ^psalms-42-11
