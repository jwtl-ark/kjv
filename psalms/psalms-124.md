# Psalms 124

**1** If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say; ^psalms-124-1

**2** If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us: ^psalms-124-2

**3** Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us: ^psalms-124-3

**4** Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul: ^psalms-124-4

**5** Then the proud waters had gone over our soul. ^psalms-124-5

**6** Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth. ^psalms-124-6

**7** Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped. ^psalms-124-7

**8** Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth. ^psalms-124-8
