# Psalms 18

**1** I will love thee, O LORD, my strength. ^psalms-18-1

**2** The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower. ^psalms-18-2

**3** I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies. ^psalms-18-3

**4** The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid. ^psalms-18-4

**5** The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me. ^psalms-18-5

**6** In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears. ^psalms-18-6

**7** Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth. ^psalms-18-7

**8** There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it. ^psalms-18-8

**9** He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet. ^psalms-18-9

**10** And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind. ^psalms-18-10

**11** He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies. ^psalms-18-11

**12** At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire. ^psalms-18-12

**13** The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire. ^psalms-18-13

**14** Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them. ^psalms-18-14

**15** Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils. ^psalms-18-15

**16** He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters. ^psalms-18-16

**17** He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me. ^psalms-18-17

**18** They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay. ^psalms-18-18

**19** He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me. ^psalms-18-19

**20** The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. ^psalms-18-20

**21** For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God. ^psalms-18-21

**22** For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me. ^psalms-18-22

**23** I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity. ^psalms-18-23

**24** Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight. ^psalms-18-24

**25** With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright; ^psalms-18-25

**26** With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward. ^psalms-18-26

**27** For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks. ^psalms-18-27

**28** For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness. ^psalms-18-28

**29** For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall. ^psalms-18-29

**30** As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him. ^psalms-18-30

**31** For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God? ^psalms-18-31

**32** It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect. ^psalms-18-32

**33** He maketh my feet like hinds’ feet, and setteth me upon my high places. ^psalms-18-33

**34** He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. ^psalms-18-34

**35** Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great. ^psalms-18-35

**36** Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip. ^psalms-18-36

**37** I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed. ^psalms-18-37

**38** I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet. ^psalms-18-38

**39** For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me. ^psalms-18-39

**40** Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me. ^psalms-18-40

**41** They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD, but he answered them not. ^psalms-18-41

**42** Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets. ^psalms-18-42

**43** Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me. ^psalms-18-43

**44** As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me. ^psalms-18-44

**45** The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places. ^psalms-18-45

**46** The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted. ^psalms-18-46

**47** It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me. ^psalms-18-47

**48** He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man. ^psalms-18-48

**49** Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name. ^psalms-18-49

**50** Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore. ^psalms-18-50
