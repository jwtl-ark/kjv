# Psalms 72

**1** Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king’s son. ^psalms-72-1

**2** He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment. ^psalms-72-2

**3** The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness. ^psalms-72-3

**4** He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor. ^psalms-72-4

**5** They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations. ^psalms-72-5

**6** He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that water the earth. ^psalms-72-6

**7** In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth. ^psalms-72-7

**8** He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth. ^psalms-72-8

**9** They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust. ^psalms-72-9

**10** The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts. ^psalms-72-10

**11** Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him. ^psalms-72-11

**12** For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper. ^psalms-72-12

**13** He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy. ^psalms-72-13

**14** He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight. ^psalms-72-14

**15** And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall he be praised. ^psalms-72-15

**16** There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth. ^psalms-72-16

**17** His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed. ^psalms-72-17

**18** Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things. ^psalms-72-18

**19** And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen. ^psalms-72-19

**20** The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended. ^psalms-72-20
