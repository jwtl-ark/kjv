# Psalms 45

**1** My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer. ^psalms-45-1

**2** Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. ^psalms-45-2

**3** Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty. ^psalms-45-3

**4** And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things. ^psalms-45-4

**5** Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king’s enemies; whereby the people fall under thee. ^psalms-45-5

**6** Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre. ^psalms-45-6

**7** Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. ^psalms-45-7

**8** All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad. ^psalms-45-8

**9** Kings’ daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir. ^psalms-45-9

**10** Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father’s house; ^psalms-45-10

**11** So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him. ^psalms-45-11

**12** And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour. ^psalms-45-12

**13** The king’s daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold. ^psalms-45-13

**14** She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee. ^psalms-45-14

**15** With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king’s palace. ^psalms-45-15

**16** Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth. ^psalms-45-16

**17** I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever. ^psalms-45-17
