# Psalms 137

**1** By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion. ^psalms-137-1

**2** We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. ^psalms-137-2

**3** For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. ^psalms-137-3

**4** How shall we sing the LORD’s song in a strange land? ^psalms-137-4

**5** If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. ^psalms-137-5

**6** If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy. ^psalms-137-6

**7** Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof. ^psalms-137-7

**8** O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us. ^psalms-137-8

**9** Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones. ^psalms-137-9
