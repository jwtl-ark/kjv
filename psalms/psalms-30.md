# Psalms 30

**1** I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me. ^psalms-30-1

**2** O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me. ^psalms-30-2

**3** O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit. ^psalms-30-3

**4** Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness. ^psalms-30-4

**5** For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning. ^psalms-30-5

**6** And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved. ^psalms-30-6

**7** LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled. ^psalms-30-7

**8** I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication. ^psalms-30-8

**9** What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth? ^psalms-30-9

**10** Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper. ^psalms-30-10

**11** Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness; ^psalms-30-11

**12** To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever. ^psalms-30-12
