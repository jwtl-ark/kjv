# Psalms 115

**1** Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth’s sake. ^psalms-115-1

**2** Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God? ^psalms-115-2

**3** But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased. ^psalms-115-3

**4** Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands. ^psalms-115-4

**5** They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not: ^psalms-115-5

**6** They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not: ^psalms-115-6

**7** They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat. ^psalms-115-7

**8** They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them. ^psalms-115-8

**9** O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. ^psalms-115-9

**10** O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. ^psalms-115-10

**11** Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. ^psalms-115-11

**12** The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron. ^psalms-115-12

**13** He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great. ^psalms-115-13

**14** The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children. ^psalms-115-14

**15** Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth. ^psalms-115-15

**16** The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD’s: but the earth hath he given to the children of men. ^psalms-115-16

**17** The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence. ^psalms-115-17

**18** But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the LORD. ^psalms-115-18
