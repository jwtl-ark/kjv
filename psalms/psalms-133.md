# Psalms 133

**1** Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! ^psalms-133-1

**2** It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron’s beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments; ^psalms-133-2

**3** As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for evermore. ^psalms-133-3
