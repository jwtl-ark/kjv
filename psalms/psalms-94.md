# Psalms 94

**1** O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself. ^psalms-94-1

**2** Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud. ^psalms-94-2

**3** LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph? ^psalms-94-3

**4** How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves? ^psalms-94-4

**5** They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage. ^psalms-94-5

**6** They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless. ^psalms-94-6

**7** Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it. ^psalms-94-7

**8** Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise? ^psalms-94-8

**9** He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see? ^psalms-94-9

**10** He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know? ^psalms-94-10

**11** The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity. ^psalms-94-11

**12** Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law; ^psalms-94-12

**13** That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked. ^psalms-94-13

**14** For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance. ^psalms-94-14

**15** But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it. ^psalms-94-15

**16** Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity? ^psalms-94-16

**17** Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence. ^psalms-94-17

**18** When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up. ^psalms-94-18

**19** In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul. ^psalms-94-19

**20** Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law? ^psalms-94-20

**21** They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood. ^psalms-94-21

**22** But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge. ^psalms-94-22

**23** And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut them off. ^psalms-94-23
