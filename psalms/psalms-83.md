# Psalms 83

**1** Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God. ^psalms-83-1

**2** For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. ^psalms-83-2

**3** They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. ^psalms-83-3

**4** They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. ^psalms-83-4

**5** For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee: ^psalms-83-5

**6** The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes; ^psalms-83-6

**7** Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre; ^psalms-83-7

**8** Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah. ^psalms-83-8

**9** Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison: ^psalms-83-9

**10** Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth. ^psalms-83-10

**11** Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna: ^psalms-83-11

**12** Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession. ^psalms-83-12

**13** O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind. ^psalms-83-13

**14** As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire; ^psalms-83-14

**15** So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm. ^psalms-83-15

**16** Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD. ^psalms-83-16

**17** Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish: ^psalms-83-17

**18** That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth. ^psalms-83-18
