# Psalms 21

**1** The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice! ^psalms-21-1

**2** Thou hast given him his heart’s desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah. ^psalms-21-2

**3** For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head. ^psalms-21-3

**4** He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever. ^psalms-21-4

**5** His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him. ^psalms-21-5

**6** For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance. ^psalms-21-6

**7** For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved. ^psalms-21-7

**8** Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee. ^psalms-21-8

**9** Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them. ^psalms-21-9

**10** Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men. ^psalms-21-10

**11** For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform. ^psalms-21-11

**12** Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them. ^psalms-21-12

**13** Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing and praise thy power. ^psalms-21-13
