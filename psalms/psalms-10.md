# Psalms 10

**1** Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble? ^psalms-10-1

**2** The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined. ^psalms-10-2

**3** For the wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth. ^psalms-10-3

**4** The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts. ^psalms-10-4

**5** His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them. ^psalms-10-5

**6** He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity. ^psalms-10-6

**7** His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity. ^psalms-10-7

**8** He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor. ^psalms-10-8

**9** He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net. ^psalms-10-9

**10** He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones. ^psalms-10-10

**11** He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it. ^psalms-10-11

**12** Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble. ^psalms-10-12

**13** Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it. ^psalms-10-13

**14** Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless. ^psalms-10-14

**15** Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none. ^psalms-10-15

**16** The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land. ^psalms-10-16

**17** LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear: ^psalms-10-17

**18** To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress. ^psalms-10-18
