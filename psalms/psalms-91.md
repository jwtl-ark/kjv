# Psalms 91

**1** He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. ^psalms-91-1

**2** I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust. ^psalms-91-2

**3** Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. ^psalms-91-3

**4** He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler. ^psalms-91-4

**5** Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; ^psalms-91-5

**6** Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. ^psalms-91-6

**7** A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. ^psalms-91-7

**8** Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked. ^psalms-91-8

**9** Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation; ^psalms-91-9

**10** There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. ^psalms-91-10

**11** For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. ^psalms-91-11

**12** They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. ^psalms-91-12

**13** Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet. ^psalms-91-13

**14** Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. ^psalms-91-14

**15** He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him. ^psalms-91-15

**16** With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation. ^psalms-91-16
