# Psalms 109

**1** Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise; ^psalms-109-1

**2** For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue. ^psalms-109-2

**3** They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause. ^psalms-109-3

**4** For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer. ^psalms-109-4

**5** And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love. ^psalms-109-5

**6** Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand. ^psalms-109-6

**7** When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin. ^psalms-109-7

**8** Let his days be few; and let another take his office. ^psalms-109-8

**9** Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow. ^psalms-109-9

**10** Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places. ^psalms-109-10

**11** Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour. ^psalms-109-11

**12** Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children. ^psalms-109-12

**13** Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out. ^psalms-109-13

**14** Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. ^psalms-109-14

**15** Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth. ^psalms-109-15

**16** Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart. ^psalms-109-16

**17** As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him. ^psalms-109-17

**18** As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones. ^psalms-109-18

**19** Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually. ^psalms-109-19

**20** Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul. ^psalms-109-20

**21** But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name’s sake: because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me. ^psalms-109-21

**22** For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me. ^psalms-109-22

**23** I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust. ^psalms-109-23

**24** My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness. ^psalms-109-24

**25** I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads. ^psalms-109-25

**26** Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy: ^psalms-109-26

**27** That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast done it. ^psalms-109-27

**28** Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice. ^psalms-109-28

**29** Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle. ^psalms-109-29

**30** I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude. ^psalms-109-30

**31** For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul. ^psalms-109-31
