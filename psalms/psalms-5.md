# Psalms 5

**1** Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation. ^psalms-5-1

**2** Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray. ^psalms-5-2

**3** My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up. ^psalms-5-3

**4** For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee. ^psalms-5-4

**5** The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity. ^psalms-5-5

**6** Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man. ^psalms-5-6

**7** But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple. ^psalms-5-7

**8** Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face. ^psalms-5-8

**9** For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue. ^psalms-5-9

**10** Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee. ^psalms-5-10

**11** But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. ^psalms-5-11

**12** For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield. ^psalms-5-12
