# Psalms 9

**1** I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works. ^psalms-9-1

**2** I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High. ^psalms-9-2

**3** When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence. ^psalms-9-3

**4** For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right. ^psalms-9-4

**5** Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever. ^psalms-9-5

**6** O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them. ^psalms-9-6

**7** But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment. ^psalms-9-7

**8** And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness. ^psalms-9-8

**9** The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble. ^psalms-9-9

**10** And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee. ^psalms-9-10

**11** Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings. ^psalms-9-11

**12** When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble. ^psalms-9-12

**13** Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death: ^psalms-9-13

**14** That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation. ^psalms-9-14

**15** The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken. ^psalms-9-15

**16** The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah. ^psalms-9-16

**17** The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God. ^psalms-9-17

**18** For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever. ^psalms-9-18

**19** Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight. ^psalms-9-19

**20** Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah. ^psalms-9-20
