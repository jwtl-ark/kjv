# Psalms 46

**1** God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. ^psalms-46-1

**2** Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; ^psalms-46-2

**3** Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah. ^psalms-46-3

**4** There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High. ^psalms-46-4

**5** God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early. ^psalms-46-5

**6** The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted. ^psalms-46-6

**7** The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah. ^psalms-46-7

**8** Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth. ^psalms-46-8

**9** He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire. ^psalms-46-9

**10** Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth. ^psalms-46-10

**11** The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah. ^psalms-46-11
