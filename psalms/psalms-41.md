# Psalms 41

**1** Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble. ^psalms-41-1

**2** The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies. ^psalms-41-2

**3** The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness. ^psalms-41-3

**4** I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee. ^psalms-41-4

**5** Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish? ^psalms-41-5

**6** And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it. ^psalms-41-6

**7** All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt. ^psalms-41-7

**8** An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more. ^psalms-41-8

**9** Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me. ^psalms-41-9

**10** But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them. ^psalms-41-10

**11** By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me. ^psalms-41-11

**12** And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever. ^psalms-41-12

**13** Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen. ^psalms-41-13
