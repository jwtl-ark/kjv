# Psalms 104

**1** Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty. ^psalms-104-1

**2** Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain: ^psalms-104-2

**3** Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind: ^psalms-104-3

**4** Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire: ^psalms-104-4

**5** Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever. ^psalms-104-5

**6** Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains. ^psalms-104-6

**7** At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away. ^psalms-104-7

**8** They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them. ^psalms-104-8

**9** Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth. ^psalms-104-9

**10** He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills. ^psalms-104-10

**11** They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst. ^psalms-104-11

**12** By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches. ^psalms-104-12

**13** He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works. ^psalms-104-13

**14** He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth; ^psalms-104-14

**15** And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man’s heart. ^psalms-104-15

**16** The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted; ^psalms-104-16

**17** Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house. ^psalms-104-17

**18** The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies. ^psalms-104-18

**19** He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down. ^psalms-104-19

**20** Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth. ^psalms-104-20

**21** The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God. ^psalms-104-21

**22** The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens. ^psalms-104-22

**23** Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening. ^psalms-104-23

**24** O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches. ^psalms-104-24

**25** So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts. ^psalms-104-25

**26** There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein. ^psalms-104-26

**27** These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season. ^psalms-104-27

**28** That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good. ^psalms-104-28

**29** Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust. ^psalms-104-29

**30** Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth. ^psalms-104-30

**31** The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works. ^psalms-104-31

**32** He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke. ^psalms-104-32

**33** I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. ^psalms-104-33

**34** My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD. ^psalms-104-34

**35** Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD. ^psalms-104-35
