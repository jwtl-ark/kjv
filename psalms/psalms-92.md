# Psalms 92

**1** IT IS A GOOD THING TO GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD, AND TO SING PRAISES UNTO THY NAME, O MOST HIGH: ^psalms-92-1

**2** To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night, ^psalms-92-2

**3** Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound. ^psalms-92-3

**4** For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands. ^psalms-92-4

**5** O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep. ^psalms-92-5

**6** A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this. ^psalms-92-6

**7** When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever: ^psalms-92-7

**8** But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore. ^psalms-92-8

**9** For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. ^psalms-92-9

**10** But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil. ^psalms-92-10

**11** Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me. ^psalms-92-11

**12** The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. ^psalms-92-12

**13** Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God. ^psalms-92-13

**14** They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing; ^psalms-92-14

**15** To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him. ^psalms-92-15
