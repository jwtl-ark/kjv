# Colossians 4

**1** Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven. ^colossians-4-1

**2** Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving; ^colossians-4-2

**3** Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds: ^colossians-4-3

**4** That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak. ^colossians-4-4

**5** Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time. ^colossians-4-5

**6** Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man. ^colossians-4-6

**7** All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord: ^colossians-4-7

**8** Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts; ^colossians-4-8

**9** With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known unto you all things which are done here. ^colossians-4-9

**10** Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister’s son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;) ^colossians-4-10

**11** And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me. ^colossians-4-11

**12** Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God. ^colossians-4-12

**13** For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis. ^colossians-4-13

**14** Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you. ^colossians-4-14

**15** Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house. ^colossians-4-15

**16** And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea. ^colossians-4-16

**17** And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it. ^colossians-4-17

**18** The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen. ^colossians-4-18
