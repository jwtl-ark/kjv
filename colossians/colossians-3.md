# Colossians 3

**1** If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. ^colossians-3-1

**2** Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. ^colossians-3-2

**3** For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. ^colossians-3-3

**4** When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory. ^colossians-3-4

**5** Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: ^colossians-3-5

**6** For which things’ sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: ^colossians-3-6

**7** In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. ^colossians-3-7

**8** But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth. ^colossians-3-8

**9** Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds; ^colossians-3-9

**10** And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him: ^colossians-3-10

**11** Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all. ^colossians-3-11

**12** Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; ^colossians-3-12

**13** Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. ^colossians-3-13

**14** And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness. ^colossians-3-14

**15** And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful. ^colossians-3-15

**16** Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. ^colossians-3-16

**17** And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him. ^colossians-3-17

**18** Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord. ^colossians-3-18

**19** Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them. ^colossians-3-19

**20** Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord. ^colossians-3-20

**21** Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged. ^colossians-3-21

**22** Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God: ^colossians-3-22

**23** And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; ^colossians-3-23

**24** Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ. ^colossians-3-24

**25** But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons. ^colossians-3-25
