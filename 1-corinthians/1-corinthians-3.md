# 1 Corinthians 3

**1** And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. ^1-corinthians-3-1

**2** I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able. ^1-corinthians-3-2

**3** For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? ^1-corinthians-3-3

**4** For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal? ^1-corinthians-3-4

**5** Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man? ^1-corinthians-3-5

**6** I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. ^1-corinthians-3-6

**7** So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. ^1-corinthians-3-7

**8** Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour. ^1-corinthians-3-8

**9** For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, ye are God’s building. ^1-corinthians-3-9

**10** According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. ^1-corinthians-3-10

**11** For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. ^1-corinthians-3-11

**12** Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; ^1-corinthians-3-12

**13** Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is. ^1-corinthians-3-13

**14** If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. ^1-corinthians-3-14

**15** If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire. ^1-corinthians-3-15

**16** Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? ^1-corinthians-3-16

**17** If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are. ^1-corinthians-3-17

**18** Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise. ^1-corinthians-3-18

**19** For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. ^1-corinthians-3-19

**20** And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain. ^1-corinthians-3-20

**21** Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours; ^1-corinthians-3-21

**22** Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; ^1-corinthians-3-22

**23** And ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s. ^1-corinthians-3-23
