# Job 24

**1** Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days? ^job-24-1

**2** Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof. ^job-24-2

**3** They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow’s ox for a pledge. ^job-24-3

**4** They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together. ^job-24-4

**5** Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children. ^job-24-5

**6** They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked. ^job-24-6

**7** They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold. ^job-24-7

**8** They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter. ^job-24-8

**9** They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor. ^job-24-9

**10** They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry; ^job-24-10

**11** Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst. ^job-24-11

**12** Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them. ^job-24-12

**13** They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof. ^job-24-13

**14** The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief. ^job-24-14

**15** The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face. ^job-24-15

**16** In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light. ^job-24-16

**17** For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death. ^job-24-17

**18** He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards. ^job-24-18

**19** Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned. ^job-24-19

**20** The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree. ^job-24-20

**21** He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow. ^job-24-21

**22** He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life. ^job-24-22

**23** Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways. ^job-24-23

**24** They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn. ^job-24-24

**25** And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth? ^job-24-25
