# Job 3

**1** After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day. ^job-3-1

**2** And Job spake, and said, ^job-3-2

**3** Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived. ^job-3-3

**4** Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it. ^job-3-4

**5** Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it. ^job-3-5

**6** As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months. ^job-3-6

**7** Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein. ^job-3-7

**8** Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning. ^job-3-8

**9** Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day: ^job-3-9

**10** Because it shut not up the doors of my mother’s womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes. ^job-3-10

**11** Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly? ^job-3-11

**12** Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck? ^job-3-12

**13** For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest, ^job-3-13

**14** With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves; ^job-3-14

**15** Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver: ^job-3-15

**16** Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light. ^job-3-16

**17** There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest. ^job-3-17

**18** There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor. ^job-3-18

**19** The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master. ^job-3-19

**20** Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul; ^job-3-20

**21** Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures; ^job-3-21

**22** Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave? ^job-3-22

**23** Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in? ^job-3-23

**24** For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters. ^job-3-24

**25** For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me. ^job-3-25

**26** I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came. ^job-3-26
