# Job 9

**1** Then Job answered and said, ^job-9-1

**2** I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God? ^job-9-2

**3** If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand. ^job-9-3

**4** He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered? ^job-9-4

**5** Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger. ^job-9-5

**6** Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble. ^job-9-6

**7** Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars. ^job-9-7

**8** Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea. ^job-9-8

**9** Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south. ^job-9-9

**10** Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number. ^job-9-10

**11** Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not. ^job-9-11

**12** Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou? ^job-9-12

**13** If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him. ^job-9-13

**14** How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him? ^job-9-14

**15** Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge. ^job-9-15

**16** If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice. ^job-9-16

**17** For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause. ^job-9-17

**18** He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness. ^job-9-18

**19** If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead? ^job-9-19

**20** If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse. ^job-9-20

**21** Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life. ^job-9-21

**22** This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. ^job-9-22

**23** If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent. ^job-9-23

**24** The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he? ^job-9-24

**25** Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good. ^job-9-25

**26** They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey. ^job-9-26

**27** If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself: ^job-9-27

**28** I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent. ^job-9-28

**29** If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain? ^job-9-29

**30** If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean; ^job-9-30

**31** Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me. ^job-9-31

**32** For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment. ^job-9-32

**33** Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both. ^job-9-33

**34** Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me: ^job-9-34

**35** Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me. ^job-9-35
