# Job 14

**1** Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. ^job-14-1

**2** He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. ^job-14-2

**3** And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee? ^job-14-3

**4** Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one. ^job-14-4

**5** Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass; ^job-14-5

**6** Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day. ^job-14-6

**7** For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. ^job-14-7

**8** Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground; ^job-14-8

**9** Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant. ^job-14-9

**10** But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? ^job-14-10

**11** As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up: ^job-14-11

**12** So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep. ^job-14-12

**13** O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me! ^job-14-13

**14** If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come. ^job-14-14

**15** Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands. ^job-14-15

**16** For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin? ^job-14-16

**17** My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity. ^job-14-17

**18** And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place. ^job-14-18

**19** The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man. ^job-14-19

**20** Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away. ^job-14-20

**21** His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them. ^job-14-21

**22** But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn. ^job-14-22
