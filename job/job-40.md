# Job 40

**1** Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said, ^job-40-1

**2** Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it. ^job-40-2

**3** Then Job answered the LORD, and said, ^job-40-3

**4** Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth. ^job-40-4

**5** Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further. ^job-40-5

**6** Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said, ^job-40-6

**7** Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. ^job-40-7

**8** Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous? ^job-40-8

**9** Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him? ^job-40-9

**10** Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty. ^job-40-10

**11** Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him. ^job-40-11

**12** Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place. ^job-40-12

**13** Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret. ^job-40-13

**14** Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee. ^job-40-14

**15** Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox. ^job-40-15

**16** Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly. ^job-40-16

**17** He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together. ^job-40-17

**18** His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron. ^job-40-18

**19** He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him. ^job-40-19

**20** Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play. ^job-40-20

**21** He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens. ^job-40-21

**22** The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about. ^job-40-22

**23** Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth. ^job-40-23

**24** He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares. ^job-40-24
