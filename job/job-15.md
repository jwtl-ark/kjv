# Job 15

**1** Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, ^job-15-1

**2** Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind? ^job-15-2

**3** Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good? ^job-15-3

**4** Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God. ^job-15-4

**5** For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty. ^job-15-5

**6** Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee. ^job-15-6

**7** Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills? ^job-15-7

**8** Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself? ^job-15-8

**9** What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us? ^job-15-9

**10** With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father. ^job-15-10

**11** Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee? ^job-15-11

**12** Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at, ^job-15-12

**13** That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth? ^job-15-13

**14** What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous? ^job-15-14

**15** Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight. ^job-15-15

**16** How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water? ^job-15-16

**17** I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare; ^job-15-17

**18** Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it: ^job-15-18

**19** Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them. ^job-15-19

**20** The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor. ^job-15-20

**21** A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him. ^job-15-21

**22** He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword. ^job-15-22

**23** He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand. ^job-15-23

**24** Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle. ^job-15-24

**25** For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty. ^job-15-25

**26** He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers: ^job-15-26

**27** Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on his flanks. ^job-15-27

**28** And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps. ^job-15-28

**29** He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth. ^job-15-29

**30** He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away. ^job-15-30

**31** Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence. ^job-15-31

**32** It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green. ^job-15-32

**33** He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive. ^job-15-33

**34** For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery. ^job-15-34

**35** They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit. ^job-15-35
