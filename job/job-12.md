# Job 12

**1** And Job answered and said, ^job-12-1

**2** No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you. ^job-12-2

**3** But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these? ^job-12-3

**4** I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn. ^job-12-4

**5** He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease. ^job-12-5

**6** The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly. ^job-12-6

**7** But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee: ^job-12-7

**8** Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee. ^job-12-8

**9** Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this? ^job-12-9

**10** In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind. ^job-12-10

**11** Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat? ^job-12-11

**12** With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding. ^job-12-12

**13** With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding. ^job-12-13

**14** Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening. ^job-12-14

**15** Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth. ^job-12-15

**16** With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his. ^job-12-16

**17** He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools. ^job-12-17

**18** He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle. ^job-12-18

**19** He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty. ^job-12-19

**20** He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged. ^job-12-20

**21** He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty. ^job-12-21

**22** He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death. ^job-12-22

**23** He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again. ^job-12-23

**24** He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way. ^job-12-24

**25** They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man. ^job-12-25
