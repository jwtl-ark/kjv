# Job 25

**1** Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, ^job-25-1

**2** Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places. ^job-25-2

**3** Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise? ^job-25-3

**4** How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman? ^job-25-4

**5** Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight. ^job-25-5

**6** How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is a worm? ^job-25-6
