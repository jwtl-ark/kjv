# Job 16

**1** Then Job answered and said, ^job-16-1

**2** I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all. ^job-16-2

**3** Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest? ^job-16-3

**4** I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul’s stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you. ^job-16-4

**5** But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief. ^job-16-5

**6** Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased? ^job-16-6

**7** But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company. ^job-16-7

**8** And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face. ^job-16-8

**9** He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me. ^job-16-9

**10** They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me. ^job-16-10

**11** God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked. ^job-16-11

**12** I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark. ^job-16-12

**13** His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground. ^job-16-13

**14** He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant. ^job-16-14

**15** I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust. ^job-16-15

**16** My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death; ^job-16-16

**17** Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure. ^job-16-17

**18** O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place. ^job-16-18

**19** Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high. ^job-16-19

**20** My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God. ^job-16-20

**21** O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour! ^job-16-21

**22** When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return. ^job-16-22
