# Job 17

**1** My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me. ^job-17-1

**2** Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation? ^job-17-2

**3** Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me? ^job-17-3

**4** For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them. ^job-17-4

**5** He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail. ^job-17-5

**6** He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret. ^job-17-6

**7** Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow. ^job-17-7

**8** Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite. ^job-17-8

**9** The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger. ^job-17-9

**10** But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you. ^job-17-10

**11** My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart. ^job-17-11

**12** They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness. ^job-17-12

**13** If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness. ^job-17-13

**14** I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister. ^job-17-14

**15** And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it? ^job-17-15

**16** They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust. ^job-17-16
