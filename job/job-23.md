# Job 23

**1** Then Job answered and said, ^job-23-1

**2** Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning. ^job-23-2

**3** Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat! ^job-23-3

**4** I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments. ^job-23-4

**5** I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me. ^job-23-5

**6** Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me. ^job-23-6

**7** There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge. ^job-23-7

**8** Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him: ^job-23-8

**9** On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him: ^job-23-9

**10** But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. ^job-23-10

**11** My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined. ^job-23-11

**12** Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food. ^job-23-12

**13** But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth. ^job-23-13

**14** For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him. ^job-23-14

**15** Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him. ^job-23-15

**16** For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me: ^job-23-16

**17** Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face. ^job-23-17
