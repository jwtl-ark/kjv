# Job 35

**1** Elihu spake moreover, and said, ^job-35-1

**2** Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God’s? ^job-35-2

**3** For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin? ^job-35-3

**4** I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee. ^job-35-4

**5** Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou. ^job-35-5

**6** If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him? ^job-35-6

**7** If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand? ^job-35-7

**8** Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man. ^job-35-8

**9** By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty. ^job-35-9

**10** But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night; ^job-35-10

**11** Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven? ^job-35-11

**12** There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men. ^job-35-12

**13** Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it. ^job-35-13

**14** Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him. ^job-35-14

**15** But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity: ^job-35-15

**16** Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge. ^job-35-16
