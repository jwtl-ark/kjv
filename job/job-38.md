# Job 38

**1** Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, ^job-38-1

**2** Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? ^job-38-2

**3** Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me. ^job-38-3

**4** Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding. ^job-38-4

**5** Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it? ^job-38-5

**6** Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof; ^job-38-6

**7** When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? ^job-38-7

**8** Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb? ^job-38-8

**9** When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it, ^job-38-9

**10** And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors, ^job-38-10

**11** And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed? ^job-38-11

**12** Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place; ^job-38-12

**13** That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it? ^job-38-13

**14** It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment. ^job-38-14

**15** And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken. ^job-38-15

**16** Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth? ^job-38-16

**17** Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death? ^job-38-17

**18** Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all. ^job-38-18

**19** Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof, ^job-38-19

**20** That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof? ^job-38-20

**21** Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the number of thy days is great? ^job-38-21

**22** Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, ^job-38-22

**23** Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war? ^job-38-23

**24** By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind upon the earth? ^job-38-24

**25** Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder; ^job-38-25

**26** To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man; ^job-38-26

**27** To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth? ^job-38-27

**28** Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew? ^job-38-28

**29** Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it? ^job-38-29

**30** The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen. ^job-38-30

**31** Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? ^job-38-31

**32** Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons? ^job-38-32

**33** Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth? ^job-38-33

**34** Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee? ^job-38-34

**35** Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are? ^job-38-35

**36** Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart? ^job-38-36

**37** Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven, ^job-38-37

**38** When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together? ^job-38-38

**39** Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions, ^job-38-39

**40** When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait? ^job-38-40

**41** Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat. ^job-38-41
