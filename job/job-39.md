# Job 39

**1** Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve? ^job-39-1

**2** Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth? ^job-39-2

**3** They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows. ^job-39-3

**4** Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them. ^job-39-4

**5** Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass? ^job-39-5

**6** Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings. ^job-39-6

**7** He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver. ^job-39-7

**8** The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing. ^job-39-8

**9** Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib? ^job-39-9

**10** Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee? ^job-39-10

**11** Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him? ^job-39-11

**12** Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn? ^job-39-12

**13** Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich? ^job-39-13

**14** Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust, ^job-39-14

**15** And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them. ^job-39-15

**16** She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers: her labour is in vain without fear; ^job-39-16

**17** Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding. ^job-39-17

**18** What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider. ^job-39-18

**19** Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder? ^job-39-19

**20** Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible. ^job-39-20

**21** He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men. ^job-39-21

**22** He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword. ^job-39-22

**23** The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield. ^job-39-23

**24** He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet. ^job-39-24

**25** He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting. ^job-39-25

**26** Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south? ^job-39-26

**27** Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high? ^job-39-27

**28** She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place. ^job-39-28

**29** From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off. ^job-39-29

**30** Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she. ^job-39-30
