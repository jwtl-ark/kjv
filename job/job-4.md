# Job 4

**1** Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, ^job-4-1

**2** If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking? ^job-4-2

**3** Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands. ^job-4-3

**4** Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees. ^job-4-4

**5** But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled. ^job-4-5

**6** Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways? ^job-4-6

**7** Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off? ^job-4-7

**8** Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same. ^job-4-8

**9** By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed. ^job-4-9

**10** The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken. ^job-4-10

**11** The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion’s whelps are scattered abroad. ^job-4-11

**12** Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof. ^job-4-12

**13** In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men, ^job-4-13

**14** Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake. ^job-4-14

**15** Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up: ^job-4-15

**16** It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying, ^job-4-16

**17** Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker? ^job-4-17

**18** Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly: ^job-4-18

**19** How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth? ^job-4-19

**20** They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it. ^job-4-20

**21** Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom. ^job-4-21
