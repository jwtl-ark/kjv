# Job 13

**1** Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it. ^job-13-1

**2** What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you. ^job-13-2

**3** Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God. ^job-13-3

**4** But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value. ^job-13-4

**5** O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom. ^job-13-5

**6** Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips. ^job-13-6

**7** Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him? ^job-13-7

**8** Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God? ^job-13-8

**9** Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him? ^job-13-9

**10** He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons. ^job-13-10

**11** Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you? ^job-13-11

**12** Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay. ^job-13-12

**13** Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will. ^job-13-13

**14** Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand? ^job-13-14

**15** Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him. ^job-13-15

**16** He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him. ^job-13-16

**17** Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears. ^job-13-17

**18** Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified. ^job-13-18

**19** Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost. ^job-13-19

**20** Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee. ^job-13-20

**21** Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid. ^job-13-21

**22** Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me. ^job-13-22

**23** How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin. ^job-13-23

**24** Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy? ^job-13-24

**25** Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble? ^job-13-25

**26** For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth. ^job-13-26

**27** Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet. ^job-13-27

**28** And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten. ^job-13-28
