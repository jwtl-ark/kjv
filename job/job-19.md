# Job 19

**1** Then Job answered and said, ^job-19-1

**2** How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words? ^job-19-2

**3** These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me. ^job-19-3

**4** And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself. ^job-19-4

**5** If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach: ^job-19-5

**6** Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net. ^job-19-6

**7** Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment. ^job-19-7

**8** He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths. ^job-19-8

**9** He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head. ^job-19-9

**10** He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree. ^job-19-10

**11** He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies. ^job-19-11

**12** His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle. ^job-19-12

**13** He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me. ^job-19-13

**14** My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me. ^job-19-14

**15** They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight. ^job-19-15

**16** I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth. ^job-19-16

**17** My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children’s sake of mine own body. ^job-19-17

**18** Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me. ^job-19-18

**19** All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me. ^job-19-19

**20** My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth. ^job-19-20

**21** Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me. ^job-19-21

**22** Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh? ^job-19-22

**23** Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book! ^job-19-23

**24** That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever! ^job-19-24

**25** For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: ^job-19-25

**26** And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: ^job-19-26

**27** Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me. ^job-19-27

**28** But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me? ^job-19-28

**29** Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment. ^job-19-29
