# Job 22

**1** Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, ^job-22-1

**2** Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself? ^job-22-2

**3** Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect? ^job-22-3

**4** Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment? ^job-22-4

**5** Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite? ^job-22-5

**6** For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing. ^job-22-6

**7** Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry. ^job-22-7

**8** But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it. ^job-22-8

**9** Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken. ^job-22-9

**10** Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee; ^job-22-10

**11** Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee. ^job-22-11

**12** Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are! ^job-22-12

**13** And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud? ^job-22-13

**14** Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven. ^job-22-14

**15** Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden? ^job-22-15

**16** Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood: ^job-22-16

**17** Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them? ^job-22-17

**18** Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me. ^job-22-18

**19** The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn. ^job-22-19

**20** Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth. ^job-22-20

**21** Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee. ^job-22-21

**22** Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart. ^job-22-22

**23** If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles. ^job-22-23

**24** Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks. ^job-22-24

**25** Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver. ^job-22-25

**26** For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God. ^job-22-26

**27** Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows. ^job-22-27

**28** Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways. ^job-22-28

**29** When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person. ^job-22-29

**30** He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands. ^job-22-30
