# Job 21

**1** But Job answered and said, ^job-21-1

**2** Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations. ^job-21-2

**3** Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on. ^job-21-3

**4** As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled? ^job-21-4

**5** Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth. ^job-21-5

**6** Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh. ^job-21-6

**7** Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power? ^job-21-7

**8** Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes. ^job-21-8

**9** Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them. ^job-21-9

**10** Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf. ^job-21-10

**11** They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance. ^job-21-11

**12** They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ. ^job-21-12

**13** They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave. ^job-21-13

**14** Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. ^job-21-14

**15** What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him? ^job-21-15

**16** Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me. ^job-21-16

**17** How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger. ^job-21-17

**18** They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away. ^job-21-18

**19** God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it. ^job-21-19

**20** His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty. ^job-21-20

**21** For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst? ^job-21-21

**22** Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high. ^job-21-22

**23** One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet. ^job-21-23

**24** His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow. ^job-21-24

**25** And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure. ^job-21-25

**26** They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them. ^job-21-26

**27** Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me. ^job-21-27

**28** For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked? ^job-21-28

**29** Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens, ^job-21-29

**30** That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath. ^job-21-30

**31** Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done? ^job-21-31

**32** Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb. ^job-21-32

**33** The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him. ^job-21-33

**34** How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood? ^job-21-34
