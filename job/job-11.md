# Job 11

**1** Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, ^job-11-1

**2** Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified? ^job-11-2

**3** Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed? ^job-11-3

**4** For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes. ^job-11-4

**5** But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee; ^job-11-5

**6** And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth. ^job-11-6

**7** Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? ^job-11-7

**8** It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know? ^job-11-8

**9** The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea. ^job-11-9

**10** If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him? ^job-11-10

**11** For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it? ^job-11-11

**12** For vain man would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass’s colt. ^job-11-12

**13** If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him; ^job-11-13

**14** If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles. ^job-11-14

**15** For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear: ^job-11-15

**16** Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away: ^job-11-16

**17** And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday: thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning. ^job-11-17

**18** And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety. ^job-11-18

**19** Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee. ^job-11-19

**20** But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost. ^job-11-20
