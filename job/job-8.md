# Job 8

**1** Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, ^job-8-1

**2** How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind? ^job-8-2

**3** Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice? ^job-8-3

**4** If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression; ^job-8-4

**5** If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty; ^job-8-5

**6** If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous. ^job-8-6

**7** Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase. ^job-8-7

**8** For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers: ^job-8-8

**9** (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:) ^job-8-9

**10** Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart? ^job-8-10

**11** Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water? ^job-8-11

**12** Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb. ^job-8-12

**13** So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite’s hope shall perish: ^job-8-13

**14** Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider’s web. ^job-8-14

**15** He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure. ^job-8-15

**16** He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden. ^job-8-16

**17** His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones. ^job-8-17

**18** If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee. ^job-8-18

**19** Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow. ^job-8-19

**20** Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers: ^job-8-20

**21** Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing. ^job-8-21

**22** They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought. ^job-8-22
