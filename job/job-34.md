# Job 34

**1** Furthermore Elihu answered and said, ^job-34-1

**2** Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge. ^job-34-2

**3** For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat. ^job-34-3

**4** Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good. ^job-34-4

**5** For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment. ^job-34-5

**6** Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression. ^job-34-6

**7** What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water? ^job-34-7

**8** Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men. ^job-34-8

**9** For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God. ^job-34-9

**10** Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity. ^job-34-10

**11** For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways. ^job-34-11

**12** Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment. ^job-34-12

**13** Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world? ^job-34-13

**14** If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath; ^job-34-14

**15** All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust. ^job-34-15

**16** If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words. ^job-34-16

**17** Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just? ^job-34-17

**18** Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly? ^job-34-18

**19** How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands. ^job-34-19

**20** In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand. ^job-34-20

**21** For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings. ^job-34-21

**22** There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. ^job-34-22

**23** For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God. ^job-34-23

**24** He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead. ^job-34-24

**25** Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed. ^job-34-25

**26** He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others; ^job-34-26

**27** Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways: ^job-34-27

**28** So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted. ^job-34-28

**29** When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only: ^job-34-29

**30** That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared. ^job-34-30

**31** Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more: ^job-34-31

**32** That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more. ^job-34-32

**33** Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest. ^job-34-33

**34** Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me. ^job-34-34

**35** Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom. ^job-34-35

**36** My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men. ^job-34-36

**37** For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God. ^job-34-37
