# Job 27

**1** Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, ^job-27-1

**2** As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul; ^job-27-2

**3** All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils; ^job-27-3

**4** My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit. ^job-27-4

**5** God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me. ^job-27-5

**6** My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live. ^job-27-6

**7** Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous. ^job-27-7

**8** For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul? ^job-27-8

**9** Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him? ^job-27-9

**10** Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God? ^job-27-10

**11** I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal. ^job-27-11

**12** Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain? ^job-27-12

**13** This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty. ^job-27-13

**14** If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread. ^job-27-14

**15** Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep. ^job-27-15

**16** Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay; ^job-27-16

**17** He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver. ^job-27-17

**18** He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper maketh. ^job-27-18

**19** The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not. ^job-27-19

**20** Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night. ^job-27-20

**21** The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place. ^job-27-21

**22** For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand. ^job-27-22

**23** Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place. ^job-27-23
