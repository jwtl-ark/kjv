# Job 41

**1** Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down? ^job-41-1

**2** Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn? ^job-41-2

**3** Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee? ^job-41-3

**4** Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever? ^job-41-4

**5** Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? ^job-41-5

**6** Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants? ^job-41-6

**7** Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears? ^job-41-7

**8** Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more. ^job-41-8

**9** Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him? ^job-41-9

**10** None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me? ^job-41-10

**11** Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine. ^job-41-11

**12** I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion. ^job-41-12

**13** Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle? ^job-41-13

**14** Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about. ^job-41-14

**15** His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal. ^job-41-15

**16** One is so near to another, that no air can come between them. ^job-41-16

**17** They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered. ^job-41-17

**18** By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. ^job-41-18

**19** Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out. ^job-41-19

**20** Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron. ^job-41-20

**21** His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth. ^job-41-21

**22** In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him. ^job-41-22

**23** The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved. ^job-41-23

**24** His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone. ^job-41-24

**25** When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves. ^job-41-25

**26** The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon. ^job-41-26

**27** He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood. ^job-41-27

**28** The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble. ^job-41-28

**29** Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear. ^job-41-29

**30** Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire. ^job-41-30

**31** He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment. ^job-41-31

**32** He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary. ^job-41-32

**33** Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear. ^job-41-33

**34** He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride. ^job-41-34
