# Job 10

**1** My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. ^job-10-1

**2** I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me. ^job-10-2

**3** Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked? ^job-10-3

**4** Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth? ^job-10-4

**5** Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man’s days, ^job-10-5

**6** That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin? ^job-10-6

**7** Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand. ^job-10-7

**8** Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me. ^job-10-8

**9** Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again? ^job-10-9

**10** Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese? ^job-10-10

**11** Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews. ^job-10-11

**12** Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit. ^job-10-12

**13** And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this is with thee. ^job-10-13

**14** If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity. ^job-10-14

**15** If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction; ^job-10-15

**16** For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me. ^job-10-16

**17** Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me. ^job-10-17

**18** Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me! ^job-10-18

**19** I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave. ^job-10-19

**20** Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little, ^job-10-20

**21** Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death; ^job-10-21

**22** A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness. ^job-10-22
