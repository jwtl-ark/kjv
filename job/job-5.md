# Job 5

**1** Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn? ^job-5-1

**2** For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one. ^job-5-2

**3** I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation. ^job-5-3

**4** His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them. ^job-5-4

**5** Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance. ^job-5-5

**6** Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground; ^job-5-6

**7** Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward. ^job-5-7

**8** I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause: ^job-5-8

**9** Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number: ^job-5-9

**10** Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields: ^job-5-10

**11** To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety. ^job-5-11

**12** He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise. ^job-5-12

**13** He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong. ^job-5-13

**14** They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the noonday as in the night. ^job-5-14

**15** But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty. ^job-5-15

**16** So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth. ^job-5-16

**17** Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty: ^job-5-17

**18** For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole. ^job-5-18

**19** He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee. ^job-5-19

**20** In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword. ^job-5-20

**21** Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh. ^job-5-21

**22** At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth. ^job-5-22

**23** For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee. ^job-5-23

**24** And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin. ^job-5-24

**25** Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth. ^job-5-25

**26** Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season. ^job-5-26

**27** Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good. ^job-5-27
