# Genesis 11

**1** And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. ^genesis-11-1

**2** And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. ^genesis-11-2

**3** And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter. ^genesis-11-3

**4** And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. ^genesis-11-4

**5** And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. ^genesis-11-5

**6** And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. ^genesis-11-6

**7** Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech. ^genesis-11-7

**8** So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city. ^genesis-11-8

**9** Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. ^genesis-11-9

**10** These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood: ^genesis-11-10

**11** And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. ^genesis-11-11

**12** And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah: ^genesis-11-12

**13** And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters. ^genesis-11-13

**14** And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber: ^genesis-11-14

**15** And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters. ^genesis-11-15

**16** And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: ^genesis-11-16

**17** And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters. ^genesis-11-17

**18** And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu: ^genesis-11-18

**19** And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters. ^genesis-11-19

**20** And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: ^genesis-11-20

**21** And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters. ^genesis-11-21

**22** And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor: ^genesis-11-22

**23** And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. ^genesis-11-23

**24** And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: ^genesis-11-24

**25** And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters. ^genesis-11-25

**26** And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran. ^genesis-11-26

**27** Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot. ^genesis-11-27

**28** And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees. ^genesis-11-28

**29** And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. ^genesis-11-29

**30** But Sarai was barren; she had no child. ^genesis-11-30

**31** And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there. ^genesis-11-31

**32** And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran. ^genesis-11-32
