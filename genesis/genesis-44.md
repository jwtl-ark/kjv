# Genesis 44

**1** And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man’s money in his sack’s mouth. ^genesis-44-1

**2** And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. ^genesis-44-2

**3** As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses. ^genesis-44-3

**4** And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? ^genesis-44-4

**5** Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing. ^genesis-44-5

**6** And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words. ^genesis-44-6

**7** And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: ^genesis-44-7

**8** Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord’s house silver or gold? ^genesis-44-8

**9** With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord’s bondmen. ^genesis-44-9

**10** And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless. ^genesis-44-10

**11** Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. ^genesis-44-11

**12** And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. ^genesis-44-12

**13** Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city. ^genesis-44-13

**14** And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground. ^genesis-44-14

**15** And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine? ^genesis-44-15

**16** And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord’s servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found. ^genesis-44-16

**17** And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father. ^genesis-44-17

**18** Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh. ^genesis-44-18

**19** My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother? ^genesis-44-19

**20** And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him. ^genesis-44-20

**21** And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. ^genesis-44-21

**22** And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die. ^genesis-44-22

**23** And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more. ^genesis-44-23

**24** And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. ^genesis-44-24

**25** And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food. ^genesis-44-25

**26** And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man’s face, except our youngest brother be with us. ^genesis-44-26

**27** And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons: ^genesis-44-27

**28** And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since: ^genesis-44-28

**29** And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. ^genesis-44-29

**30** Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad’s life; ^genesis-44-30

**31** It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave. ^genesis-44-31

**32** For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever. ^genesis-44-32

**33** Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. ^genesis-44-33

**34** For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father. ^genesis-44-34
