# Genesis 10

**1** Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood. ^genesis-10-1

**2** The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. ^genesis-10-2

**3** And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. ^genesis-10-3

**4** And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. ^genesis-10-4

**5** By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations. ^genesis-10-5

**6** And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan. ^genesis-10-6

**7** And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan. ^genesis-10-7

**8** And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. ^genesis-10-8

**9** He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD. ^genesis-10-9

**10** And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. ^genesis-10-10

**11** Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, ^genesis-10-11

**12** And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city. ^genesis-10-12

**13** And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, ^genesis-10-13

**14** And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim. ^genesis-10-14

**15** And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth, ^genesis-10-15

**16** And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite, ^genesis-10-16

**17** And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, ^genesis-10-17

**18** And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad. ^genesis-10-18

**19** And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha. ^genesis-10-19

**20** These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations. ^genesis-10-20

**21** Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born. ^genesis-10-21

**22** The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram. ^genesis-10-22

**23** And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash. ^genesis-10-23

**24** And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber. ^genesis-10-24

**25** And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother’s name was Joktan. ^genesis-10-25

**26** And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah, ^genesis-10-26

**27** And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, ^genesis-10-27

**28** And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba, ^genesis-10-28

**29** And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan. ^genesis-10-29

**30** And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east. ^genesis-10-30

**31** These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations. ^genesis-10-31

**32** These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood. ^genesis-10-32
