# Genesis 20

**1** And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar. ^genesis-20-1

**2** And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah. ^genesis-20-2

**3** But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man’s wife. ^genesis-20-3

**4** But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation? ^genesis-20-4

**5** Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this. ^genesis-20-5

**6** And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. ^genesis-20-6

**7** Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine. ^genesis-20-7

**8** Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid. ^genesis-20-8

**9** Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done. ^genesis-20-9

**10** And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing? ^genesis-20-10

**11** And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife’s sake. ^genesis-20-11

**12** And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. ^genesis-20-12

**13** And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother. ^genesis-20-13

**14** And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife. ^genesis-20-14

**15** And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee. ^genesis-20-15

**16** And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved. ^genesis-20-16

**17** So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children. ^genesis-20-17

**18** For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham’s wife. ^genesis-20-18
