# Exodus 6

**1** Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land. ^exodus-6-1

**2** And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD: ^exodus-6-2

**3** And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them. ^exodus-6-3

**4** And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers. ^exodus-6-4

**5** And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant. ^exodus-6-5

**6** Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments: ^exodus-6-6

**7** And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. ^exodus-6-7

**8** And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD. ^exodus-6-8

**11** Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land. ^exodus-6-11
