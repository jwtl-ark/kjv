# Titus 1

**1** Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness; ^titus-1-1

**2** In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began; ^titus-1-2

**3** But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour; ^titus-1-3

**4** To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour. ^titus-1-4

**5** For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee: ^titus-1-5

**6** If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly. ^titus-1-6

**7** For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre; ^titus-1-7

**8** But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate; ^titus-1-8

**9** Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers. ^titus-1-9

**10** For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision: ^titus-1-10

**11** Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake. ^titus-1-11

**12** One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies. ^titus-1-12

**13** This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith; ^titus-1-13

**14** Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth. ^titus-1-14

**15** Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled. ^titus-1-15

**16** They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate. ^titus-1-16
