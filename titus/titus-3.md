# Titus 3

**1** Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work, ^titus-3-1

**2** To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men. ^titus-3-2

**3** For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. ^titus-3-3

**4** But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, ^titus-3-4

**5** Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; ^titus-3-5

**6** Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; ^titus-3-6

**7** That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. ^titus-3-7

**8** This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men. ^titus-3-8

**9** But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. ^titus-3-9

**10** A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject; ^titus-3-10

**11** Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself. ^titus-3-11

**12** When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter. ^titus-3-12

**13** Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them. ^titus-3-13

**14** And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful. ^titus-3-14

**15** All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen. ^titus-3-15
