# John 7

**1** After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him. ^john-7-1

**2** Now the Jews’ feast of tabernacles was at hand. ^john-7-2

**3** His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest. ^john-7-3

**4** For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world. ^john-7-4

**5** For neither did his brethren believe in him. ^john-7-5

**6** Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready. ^john-7-6

**7** The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil. ^john-7-7

**8** Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my time is not yet full come. ^john-7-8

**9** When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee. ^john-7-9

**10** But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret. ^john-7-10

**11** Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? ^john-7-11

**12** And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people. ^john-7-12

**13** Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews. ^john-7-13

**14** Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. ^john-7-14

**15** And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned? ^john-7-15

**16** Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. ^john-7-16

**17** If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. ^john-7-17

**18** He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. ^john-7-18

**19** Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me? ^john-7-19

**20** The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee? ^john-7-20

**21** Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel. ^john-7-21

**22** Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man. ^john-7-22

**23** If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day? ^john-7-23

**24** Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment. ^john-7-24

**25** Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill? ^john-7-25

**26** But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ? ^john-7-26

**27** Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is. ^john-7-27

**28** Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not. ^john-7-28

**29** But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me. ^john-7-29

**30** Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come. ^john-7-30

**31** And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done? ^john-7-31

**32** The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him. ^john-7-32

**33** Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me. ^john-7-33

**34** Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come. ^john-7-34

**35** Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles? ^john-7-35

**36** What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come? ^john-7-36

**37** In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. ^john-7-37

**38** He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. ^john-7-38

**39** (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.) ^john-7-39

**40** Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet. ^john-7-40

**41** Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee? ^john-7-41

**42** Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was? ^john-7-42

**43** So there was a division among the people because of him. ^john-7-43

**44** And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him. ^john-7-44

**45** Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him? ^john-7-45

**46** The officers answered, Never man spake like this man. ^john-7-46

**47** Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived? ^john-7-47

**48** Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him? ^john-7-48

**49** But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed. ^john-7-49

**50** Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,) ^john-7-50

**51** Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth? ^john-7-51

**52** They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet. ^john-7-52

**53** And every man went unto his own house. ^john-7-53
