# Philemon 1

**1** Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer, ^philemon-1-1

**2** And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house: ^philemon-1-2

**3** Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. ^philemon-1-3

**4** I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, ^philemon-1-4

**5** Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints; ^philemon-1-5

**6** That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. ^philemon-1-6

**7** For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother. ^philemon-1-7

**8** Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient, ^philemon-1-8

**9** Yet for love’s sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. ^philemon-1-9

**10** I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds: ^philemon-1-10

**11** Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me: ^philemon-1-11

**12** Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels: ^philemon-1-12

**13** Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel: ^philemon-1-13

**14** But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly. ^philemon-1-14

**15** For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever; ^philemon-1-15

**16** Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord? ^philemon-1-16

**17** If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. ^philemon-1-17

**18** If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account; ^philemon-1-18

**19** I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides. ^philemon-1-19

**20** Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord. ^philemon-1-20

**21** Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say. ^philemon-1-21

**22** But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you. ^philemon-1-22

**23** There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus; ^philemon-1-23

**24** Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers. ^philemon-1-24

**25** The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. ^philemon-1-25
